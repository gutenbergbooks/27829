<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The object of this volume is to describe the principal customs
and ideas that underlie all public religion; the details are selected
from a large mass of material, which is increasing in bulk year by
year. References to the higher religions are introduced for the
purpose of illustrating lines of progress.</p>

<p>The analytic table of contents and the index are meant to supplement
each other, the one giving the outline of the discussion,
the other giving the more important particulars; the two together
will facilitate the consultation of the book. In the selected list of
works of reference the titles are arranged, as far as possible, in
chronological order, so as to indicate in a general way the progress
of investigation in the subjects mentioned.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to the publishers for the care they have taken
in the printing of the volume, and to their proofreaders, particularly
to the chief proofreader, for not a few helpful suggestions.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />
HISTORY OF RELIGIONS</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>NATURE OF RELIGION</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_1" id="p_1">1</a></b>. It appears probable that primitive men endowed with their
own qualities every seemingly active object in the world. Experience
forced them to take note of the relations of all objects to themselves
and to one another. The knowledge of the sequences of phenomena,
so far as the latter are not regarded as acting intentionally on him,
constitutes man's science and philosophy; so far as they are held
to act on him intentionally, the knowledge of them constitutes his
theory of religion, and his sense of relation with them is his religious
sentiment. Science and religion are coeval in man's history,
and both are independently continuous and progressive. At first
science is in the background because most objects, since they are
believed to be alive and active, are naturally supposed by man to
affect him purposely; it grows slowly, keeping pace with observation,
and constantly abstracting phenomena from the domain of religion.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Religion is man's attitude toward the universe regarded as a social
and ethical force; it is the sense of social solidarity with objects regarded
as Powers, and the institution of social relations with them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_2" id="p_2">2</a></b>. These Powers are thought of in general as mysterious, and
as mightier than ordinary living men.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Ordinarily the feeling toward
them on man's part is one of dependence&mdash;he is conscious of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>inferiority. In some forms of philosophic thought the man regards
himself as part of the one universal personal Power, or as part of
the impersonal Whole, and his attitude toward the Power or the
Whole is like that of a member of a composite political body toward
the whole body; such a position is possible, however, only in a
period of very advanced culture.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_3" id="p_3">3</a></b>. There being no records of initial humanity, it is hardly possible
for us to know certainly what the earliest men's feeling was
toward the animate and inanimate forces around them. Not improbably
it was simply fear, the result of ignorance of their nature
and absence of social relations with them. But in the human
communities known to us, even the lowest, the relations with extrahuman
beings appear to be in general of a mixed nature, sometimes
friendly, sometimes unfriendly, but neither pure love nor
pure hatred. So refined a feeling as love for a deity is not found
among savages. As religion springs from the human demand for
safety and happiness as the gift of the extrahuman Powers, hostility
to them has been generally felt to be opposed to common sense.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Coercion there has been, as in magical procedures, or to bring a
stubborn deity to terms; and occasional antagonism (for example,
toward foreign gods); but not hatred proper as a dogma, except
in the great ethical religions toward evil spirits, and in certain elaborate
philosophic systems&mdash;as, for example, in the Gnostic conception
of an imperfect Demiurge, or in the assumption of an original
blind Chance or blind Will whose products and laws are regarded
as not entitled to respect and obedience.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_4" id="p_4">4</a></b>. Instead of complete friendliness and unfriendliness in early
tribes we find more commonly between the two a middle ground
of self-regarding equipoise. The savage, the half-civilized man, and
the peasant often deal with superhuman Powers in a purely selfish
commercial spirit, courting or neglecting them as they seem likely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>to be useful or not. The Central Australian (who may be credited
with a dim sense of the superhuman) conducts his ceremonies, intended
to insure a supply of food, apparently without the slightest
emotion of any sort except the desire for gain.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The Italian peasant,
who has vowed a wax candle to a saint in return for a favor
to be shown, does not scruple to cheat the saint, after the latter
has performed his part of the agreement, by offering tallow instead
of wax, if he thinks he can do so with impunity. A recusant deity
is sometimes neglected or even kicked by way of punishment or to
force him to give the desired aid, and a god or a saint is valued and
sought after in proportion to his supposed ability to be useful.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_5" id="p_5">5</a></b>. And this na&iuml;vely utilitarian point of view is by no means confined
to the lowest forms of religion; in the Old Testament, for
example, the appeal to Yahveh is generally based on his assumed
power to bestow temporal blessings,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and this is a widespread attitude
at the present day in religious communities, where salvation is
commonly the end had in view by the worshiper. Love toward the
deity simply on account of his personal moral character, without regard
to the benefit (namely happiness) to be got from him, is found,
if found at all, only in highly cultivated natures, and is rare in these.
And, in truth, it is difficult if not impossible to justify religion except
on the ground that it brings satisfaction (that is, happiness through
and in perfection of nature) in the broadest and highest sense of
that term, for otherwise it could not be regarded as a good thing.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_6" id="p_6">6</a></b>. On the other hand, fear of the superhuman Power is a common
feeling, recognizable everywhere, at all times, and in all stages of
social and intellectual development. By many it is regarded as the
original and essential attitude of the religious mind.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> To this view
it is sometimes objected that religion could never have arisen from
fear&mdash;that religion, as a cult, of necessity involves amicable relations
between man and the deity. The objection, however, is based
on an arbitrary and incorrect definition of religion; it is quite conceivable
that man might cultivate the deity through fear of the
latter's displeasure, and that an elaborate system of ceremonies
and beliefs might arise from the desire to avert his anger. Such
a conception&mdash;which is certainly not a lofty one&mdash;is not unnatural
in the presence of a great Power whose dispositions and
purposes are not well understood; numerous examples of such an
attitude might be cited from various religions, savage and civilized.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
<b><a name="p_7" id="p_7">7</a></b>. But, on historical grounds, as in the examples given above, it
seems better to say that the earliest known attitude of man toward
the superhuman Power is one of interested observation and fluid
emotion&mdash;the feeling is determined by experience of phenomena.
The man is pleased, displeased and afraid, suspicious or careless,
according as he sees things to be helpful, harmful, doubtful, or
resultless. In process of time, by observation and reflection, he
succeeds in tabulating phenomena, and more or less definitely fixing
his emotional attitude toward their assumed cause. A tradition is
gradually established, and men are trained from infancy to welcome
certain things, to fear others, and to accept certain others as
meaningless; from time to time strange things will appear, and these
will be treated according to established principles or will remain
mysterious. A germinal conception of natural law will arise from
the observation of periodically occurring phenomena (such as the
rising and setting of the sun, periodic rains, tides) and familiar facts
of everyday life, as, for example, the habits of men and other animals.
Everything outside this sphere will be ascribed to extrahuman
agency&mdash;so sickness, death, and sometimes birth.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_8" id="p_8">8</a></b>. The history of religion, which is a part of the history of thought,
necessarily shows, as is observed above, a constant enlargement of
the domain of natural law, and a consequent contraction of the
direct action of the supernatural, though this does not always or
generally lessen the conviction that the Supernatural Power, acting
through natural law, controls all things. In this process, also, the
conception of the attitude of the Supernatural Power is more or
less definitely fixed; a formulation of signs is accomplished, whereby
it is known whether the deity, at particular moments, is pleased or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>displeased, and whether a given deity is generally friendly or hostile.
This method of determining the attitude of the deity continued into
late stages of social life, and still exists even in professedly Christian
communities.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_9" id="p_9">9</a></b>. As the basis of the religious feeling we must suppose a sense
and conception of an extrahuman Something, the cause of things
not otherwise understood. All things were supposed to have life,
and therefore to be loci of force; man's sense of social relation with
this force constituted his religion. This sense was at first doubtless
vague, ill-defined, or undefined, and in this form it is now found in
certain tribes.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Gradually, as the processes of human life and of
the external world become better known, and the vastness of the
extrahuman control becomes evident, the Something is conceived
of as great, then as indefinitely great, and finally, under the guidance
of philosophic thought, as infinite. Thus the sense of the infinite
may be said to be present in man's mind in germinal form at the
beginning of truly human life, though it does not attain full shape,
is not formulated, and is not effective, till the period of philosophic
culture is reached.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_10" id="p_10">10</a></b>. As far as our present knowledge goes, religion appears to be
universal among men. There is no community of which we can
say with certainty that it is without religion. There are some doubtful
cases&mdash;for example, certain Australian tribes reported on by
Spencer and Gillen, among whom it is difficult to discover any definite
religious feeling: they offer no sacrifices or petitions, and appear
to recognize no personal relations with any supernatural Power,
beyond the belief that the spirits of the dead are active in their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>midst, causing sickness, death, and birth; nor is there any sign that
they have lost earlier more definite beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Yet they have solemn
ceremonies in which human blood plays a great part, and these
may have reference to the intervention of supernatural beings, the
term "supernatural" being taken as expressing any mysterious
fact lying outside of the common course of things. A mysterious
being called Twan is spoken of in initiation ceremonies, chiefly, it
seems, to frighten or train the boys. Is there an indication that
the tribal leaders have risen above the popular belief in such a
being? Experience shows that it is difficult for civilized men to get
at the religious ideas of savages; and it is possible, in spite of the
careful investigations thus far made, that the last word on Central
Australian beliefs has not yet been spoken. A similar reserve must
be exercised in regard to reports of certain other tribes, whose
ceremonies and institutions have appeared to some European and
American observers to be without a religious element.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_11" id="p_11">11</a></b>. There is at present no satisfactory historical evidence (whatever
psychological ground there may be, or whatever deduction
from the theory of evolution may seem necessary) of the existence
of a subreligious stage of human life&mdash;a stage in which there is
only a vague sense of some extrahuman power affecting man's
interests, without definition of the power, and without attempt to
enter into social relations with it.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_12" id="p_12">12</a></b>. True, in the great mass of existing savage humanity we
find social and religious customs so definite that we are forced to
suppose a long preceding period of development. It has even been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>held that traces of religious conceptions are discernible in the first
surviving records of "prehistoric" man, the contemporary of the
cave bear&mdash;a period separated from the earliest clear historical
records by many millenniums;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> but, though the existence of such
conceptions is by no means improbable, the alleged traces are too
dim to build a theory on. The supposition of a continuous religious
development from the earliest times is in accord with all that we know
of human history, but, until more facts come to light, it will be prudent
to reserve opinion as to the character of prehistoric religion.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_13" id="p_13">13</a></b>. In general, religious development goes hand in hand with
social organization. Those groups which, like the Rock Veddas
of Ceylon (described by Sarasin) and the Yahgans of Tierra del
Fuego (described by Hyades and Deniker), have scarcely any clan
organization, have also scarcely any religion. In most of the lowest
communities known to us we find well-constituted clans and tribes,
with strict (and usually complicated) laws of relationship and marriage,
and a somewhat developed form of religion.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Here again it
is evident that we see in the world only the later stages of a long
social process; the antecedent history of this process belongs to
sociological science, and does not concern us here;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> its later history
is inseparably connected with the development of religion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<b><a name="p_14" id="p_14">14</a></b>. It is in this social process that science, philosophy, art, and
ethics are constructed, and these, though distinct from the religious
sentiment, always blend with it into a unity of life. Religion proper
is simply an attitude toward a Power; the nature and activity of the
Power and the mode of approaching it are constructed by man's
observation and reflection. The analysis of the external world and
of man's body and mind, the discovery of natural laws, the history
of the internal and external careers of the human race&mdash;this is the
affair of science and philosophy; rules of conduct, individual and
communal, grow up through men's association with one another in
society, their basis being certain primary instincts of self-assertion
and sympathy; art is the product of the universal sense of beauty.
All these lines of growth stand side by side and coalesce in unitary
human life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_15" id="p_15">15</a></b>. The external history of religion is the history of the process
by which the religious sentiment has attached itself to the various
conceptions formed by man's experience: ritual is the religious
application of the code of social manners; the gods reflect human
character; churches follow the methods of social organization; monotheism
springs from the sense of the physical and moral unity of
the world. Ideas concerning the nature and functions of the deity,
the nature of the soul and of conscience, and future life are all
products of scientific thought and might exist if religion did not
exist, that is, if men did not recognize any practical relations between
themselves and the deity. But, as a matter of fact, the religious sentiment,
coexisting with these ideas, has always entered into alliance
with them, creating nothing, but appropriating everything. Supernatural
sanctions and emotional coloring are products of general
experience and feeling. The intellectual and ethical content of religion
varies with the intellectual and ethical culture of its adherents;
we may speak properly of the philosophy and morals, not of
a religion, but of the people who profess it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_16" id="p_16">16</a></b>. The internal history of religion is the history of individual
religious emotional experience (a phenomenon that hardly appears
at all in the records of early life), and becomes especially interesting
only in periods of advanced culture. It is true that this experience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
is based on the whole reflective life of man, whose beginnings go
back to the earliest times. Aspirations and ideals, connected especially
with man's religious life, spring from the long line of experiences
with which men have always been struggling. The central
fact of the higher religious experience is communion and union
with the deity, and the roots of this conception are found in all
the religious ideas and usages that have been formulated and
practiced in human history. The study of such ideas and practices
is thus important for the understanding of the later more refined
spiritual life, as in turn this latter throws light on its crude predecessors.
It is no disparagement to the higher forms of thought
that they have grown from feeble beginnings, and it does not detract
from the historical value of primitive life that we must decline
to credit it with depth and refinement. Every phase and every
stadium of human experience has its value, and the higher stages
must be estimated by what they are in themselves. In the history
of religion the outward and the inward elements have stood side
by side in a unitary experience. But, though the deeper feeling is
necessarily more or less closely connected with the external history,
it is an independent fact requiring a separate treatment, and will
be only occasionally referred to in the present volume.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>THE SOUL</h4>


<p><b><a name="p_17" id="p_17">17</a></b>. The doctrine of the soul is so interwoven with the history of
religious beliefs that a brief statement of its early forms will be
appropriate before we enter on the consideration of religious institutions
and ideas.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>


<h5>1. <span class="smcap">Nature of the Soul</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_18" id="p_18">18</a></b>. The belief in an interior something in man, different from
the body, appears to be practically universal in early human history;
the ideas concerning the nature of the soul have changed from time
to time, but no tribe of men has yet been found in which it is certain
that there is no belief in its existence. The Central Australians, religiously
one of the least-developed communities known, believe in
ghosts, and a ghost presupposes some sort of substance different
from the ordinary body. Of some tribes, as the Pygmies of Central
Africa and the Fuegians, we have no exact information on this point.
But in all cases in which there is information traces of a belief in a
soul are found. We are not concerned here with philosophic views,
like that of Buddhism and many modern psychologists, that do not
admit the existence of the soul as a separate entity. The proofs of
the universality of the belief in a soul are scattered through all books
that deal with man's religious constitution and history.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_19" id="p_19">19</a></b>. For the basis of a universal fact of human experience we
naturally seek a universal or essential element of human thought.
In this case we must assume a natural or instinctive conviction of
the existence of an internal life or being&mdash;a consciousness (at first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>doubtless dim and vague) of something diverse and separate from
the visible physical being, a sense of mental activity in thought,
feeling, and will.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_20" id="p_20">20</a></b>. It is not surprising that we do not meet with the expression
of such a consciousness among savages: partly, as is well known,
they are like children, intellectually incapable of formulating their
instinctive beliefs (and they have, consequently, no word to express
such a formulation); partly, they are not disposed to speak frankly
on subjects that they regard as sacred or mysterious. Attempts at
formulation follow the lines of culture, and it is not till a comparatively
late stage that they reach definite shape.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_21" id="p_21">21</a></b>. The interior being, whose existence was vaguely felt, was
recognized by early man in many common experiences. Certain
phenomena were observed that seemed to be universal accompaniments
of life, and these, by a strictly scientific method of procedure,
were referred to an inward living thing. It was hardly possible for
early observers not to notice that when the breath ceased the life
ceased; hence many peoples have regarded the breath as the life,
and as the form of the interior being, and in many languages the
words for 'soul' and 'spirit' are derived from the word for
'breath'.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The breath and therefore the soul of a dying man might
be received (inhaled) by any person present; it was sometimes
obligatory on a son to receive his father's last breath&mdash;he thereby
acquired the father's qualities.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_22" id="p_22">22</a></b>. Another accompaniment of the body that attracted the
attention of early men was the shadow, for which the science of
that day, unacquainted with optical laws, could account only on
the supposition that it was a double of the man, another self, a
something belonging in the same general category with the breath-soul,
though usually distinguished from it.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The shadow was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>regarded as a sort of independent objective being, which might be
seized and destroyed, for example, by a crocodile, as the man
passed along a river bank; yet, as it was the man, its destruction
involved the man's death.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The soul, regarded as a shadow, could
not cast a shadow. Similarly one's reflection in water was regarded
as a double of him.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_23" id="p_23">23</a></b>. Blood was known by observation in very early times to be
intimately connected with life, acquired the mystery and sacredness
that attached to life, and has played a great part in religious ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
As soul is life, a close relation between blood and soul
appears in the thought of lower and higher peoples, though the
relation is not always the same as that described above. The blood
is sometimes said to be the soul,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> sometimes the soul is supposed
to be in the blood as it is in the hair or any other part of the body.
Blood could not be regarded as the soul in the same sense in which
the breath, for example, was the soul&mdash;if the breath departed the
man's life departed, but one could lose much blood without injury
to vital power. It is not to be expected that the relation between
the two should be precisely defined in the early stages of society.
If Homer at one time speaks of the soul passing away through a
wound and at another time of the blood so passing (death being
the result),<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> this variation must not be pressed into a statement of
the exact identity of blood and soul. By the Californian Maidu the
soul is spoken of as a 'heart', apparently by reason of the connection
of the heart with the blood and the life.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> There is to be
recognized, then, a vague identification of 'soul' and 'blood'; but in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>common usage the two terms are somewhat differently employed&mdash;'soul'
is the vital entity, the man's personality, 'blood' is the representative
of life, especially on its social side (kinsmen are of "one
blood," but not of "one soul")<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and in offerings to the deity. Early
man seems, in fact, to have distinguished between life and soul.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_24" id="p_24">24</a></b>. As the soul was conceived of as an independent being, it
was natural that it should be held to have a form like that of the
external body&mdash;it could not be thought of otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> This
opinion was doubtless confirmed in the savage mind by such experiences
as dreams, visions, hallucinations, and illusions, and by
such phenomena as shadows and reflections. The dreamer believed
that he had been far away during the night, hunting or fighting,
and yet the testimony of his comrades convinced him that his body
had not left its place; the logical conclusion was that his inner self
had been wandering, and this self, as it seemed to him, had walked,
eaten, hurled the spear, done all that the ordinary corporeal man
would do. In dreams he saw and conversed with his friends or his
enemies, all in corporeal form, yet all of them asleep in their several
places; their souls also, he concluded, were wandering. Even in
his waking hours, in the gloom of evening or on some wide gleaming
plain, he saw, as he thought, shadowy shapes of persons who
were dead or far away, and heard mysterious voices and other
sounds, which he would naturally refer to the inner self of the
absent living or the dead. Reproductions of himself and others
appeared on land and in water. All such experiences would go to
convince him that there were doubles of himself and of others, and
that these were corporeal&mdash;only dim, ethereal, with powers greater
than those of the ordinary external body.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_25" id="p_25">25</a></b>. While the soul of the living man was most commonly conceived
of as a sublimated replica of the ordinary body, it was also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>supposed in some cases to take the form of some animal&mdash;an
opinion that may have arisen as regards any particular animal from
its appearance at a time when the soul was supposed to be absent
from the body,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and is to be referred ultimately to the belief in the
identity of nature of animals and man. The souls of the dead also
were sometimes supposed to take the shape of animals, or to take
up their abode in animals<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> or in trees (as in Egypt): such animals
(tigers, for example) were commonly dangerous, and this theory of
incarnation is an expression of the widely diffused belief in the
dangerous character of the souls of the dead. In later, cultivated
times the bird became a favorite symbol of the soul&mdash;perhaps
from its swift and easy flight through the air.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_26" id="p_26">26</a></b>. Savage science, though it generally identified the soul with
the breath, and regarded it as a separate interior form, seems not
to have attempted to define its precise locus, posture, and extension
within the body&mdash;the early man was content to regard it as a
vague homunculus. The whole body was looked on as the seat of
life, and was sometimes eaten in order to acquire its qualities,
especially the quality of courage.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Life was supposed to reside in
the bones as the solid part of the body, and these were preserved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>as the basis of a future life.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> But even in early stages of culture
we find a tendency to specialize&mdash;courage, for example, was assigned
particularly to the head and the heart, which were accounted
the most desirable parts of a dead enemy.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> These organs were
selected probably on account of their prominence&mdash;the heart also
because it was the receptacle of the blood. The soul was located
by the Indians of Guiana in the pupil of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_27" id="p_27">27</a></b>. Gradually a more precise localization of qualities was made
by the Semites, Greeks, Romans, and other peoples. These, for
reasons not clearly known to us, assigned the principal emotional
faculties to the most prominent organs of the trunk of the body.
The Semites placed thought and courage in the heart and the liver,
anger in the liver (the bile), love and grief in the bowels, voluntary
power in the kidneys.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The Greeks and Romans were less definite:
to the heart, the diaphragm, and the liver (the upper half of
the trunk); the Greeks assigned thought, courage, emotion;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> the
Romans placed thought and courage in the heart, and the affections
in the liver. Among these organs special prominence came
to be given to the heart and the liver as seats of mental faculties.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_28" id="p_28">28</a></b>. It is not clear how early the brain was supposed to be connected
with the mind. Alcm&aelig;on of Crotona (5th cent. b.c.), who,
according to Diogenes Laertius, wrote chiefly on medical subjects,
is credited with the view that the brain was the constructor of
thought.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Plato suggests that the brain may be the seat of perception
and then of memory and reflection, and calls the head the
most divine part of man.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Cicero reports that some persons looked
on some part of the cerebrum as the chief seat of the mind.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>In the Semitic languages the first occurrence of a term for 'brain' is
in the Arabic.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Some American tribes are said to regard the brain
as the seat of the mind.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> The scientific Greek view appears to have
been connected with medical research, but the process by which
it was reached has not been recorded. The Arabic conception of
the brain was probably borrowed from the Greeks.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_29" id="p_29">29</a></b>. The soul as an independent personality was supposed to
leave the body at times, and its departure entailed various consequences&mdash;in
general the result was the withdrawal of the man's
ordinary powers to a greater or less extent, according to the duration
of the soul's absence. The consequences might be sleep,
trance, swoon, coma, death; the precise nature of the effect was
determined by the man's subsequent condition&mdash;he would wake
from sleep, or return to his ordinary state from a trance, or come
to himself from a swoon, or lie permanently motionless in death.
When he seemed to be dead there was often doubt as to his real
condition&mdash;the escaped soul might seek its old abode (as in the
case of the vampire, for instance), and means were sometimes
taken to prevent its return.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_30" id="p_30">30</a></b>. The obvious difference in serious results between sleep and
other cessations of the ordinary consciousness and activity led
among some tribes to the supposition of a special dream-soul that
could leave the body without injury to the man. It was believed
by certain Greenlanders<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that a man going on a journey might
leave his soul behind. It was a not uncommon opinion that souls
might be taken out for a while, with friendly intent, to guard them
during a period of danger (so in Celebes when a family moves into
a new house). In Greenland, according to Cranz, a damaged soul
might be repaired. Or the soul might be removed with evil intent
by magic art&mdash;the result would be sickness or swoon; it was
then incumbent on the sufferer or his friends to discover the hostile
magician and counteract his work by stronger magic, or force him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>to restore the soul.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> On the other hand, the soul of a dead man
might be so recalled that the man would live again, the usual
agency being a god, a magician, or a prophet.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_31" id="p_31">31</a></b>. It has been and is a widespread opinion in low tribes that
the life of a person is bound up with that of an animal or plant,
or with the preservation of something closely connected with the
person. This opinion springs from the conviction of the intimate
vital relation between men and their surroundings. From the combination
of these beliefs with the view referred to above<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> that a
man's soul might dwell in a beast or a plant, the idea of the hidden
soul, common in folk-lore, may have arisen<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>&mdash;the idea that one
might conceal his soul in some unsuspected place and then would
be free from fear of death so long as his soul remained undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
These folk-tales are products of the popular imagination
based on materials such as those described above. From the early
point of view there was no reason why the vital soul, an independent
entity, should not lead a locally separate life.</p>


<h5>2. <span class="smcap">Origin of the Soul</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_32" id="p_32">32</a></b>. Theories of a special origination of the soul belong only to
the more advanced cults. In early stages of culture the soul is
taken as a natural part of the human constitution, and though it is
regarded as in a sort an independent entity, the analysis of the
man is not carried so far as to raise the question of separate beginnings
of the two constituents of the personality, except as this
is partially involved in the hypothesis of reincarnation. The child
is born into the world equipped with all the capacities of man, and
further investigation as to how these capacities originally came is
not made.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_33" id="p_33">33</a></b>. It was, however, thought necessary to account for the appearance
of man (a clan or tribe) on earth, and his creation was
generally ascribed to a supernatural being. Every tribe has its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>history of man's creation&mdash;the variety in the anthropogonic myths
is endless, the diversities depending on the differences of general culture
and of surroundings; but the essential point is the same in all;
some god or other supernatural Power fashioned human creatures of
different sex, whether with well-considered aim or by caprice is not said.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_34" id="p_34">34</a></b>. The first pair is thus accounted for in a simple and generally
satisfactory manner. But the fact of the perpetuation of the tribe
or the race appears to have offered serious difficulties to the savage
mind. Some tribes are reported to be ignorant of the natural cause
of birth. Some Melanesian women believe that the origin or beginning
of a child is a plant (coconut or other), and that the child will
be the <i>nunu</i> (something like an echo) of that thing or of a dead person
(this is not the transition of a soul&mdash;the child takes the place
of the dead person). In Mota there is a similar belief.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The Central
Australians, it is said, think that the birth of a child is due to the entrance
of a spirit into the body of a woman<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>&mdash;every child is thus
the reincarnation of some ancient person (an "ancestor"), and the
particular person is identified by the sacred object (stone or tree, or
other object) near which the woman is when she first becomes aware
of the child within her; every such object (and there are many of
them near any village) represents some spirit whose name is known
to the old men of the tribe, and this name is given the child.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_35" id="p_35">35</a></b>. Similar theories of birth are found among the Eskimo<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and
the Khonds,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> in Melanesia,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> in West Africa,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>views thus appear to have been widely diffused, and are in fact a
natural product of early biological science. They embody the earliest
known form of the doctrine of reincarnation, which is so important
in the Buddhistic dogma.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> With it must be connected the fact that
among many peoples (savage, half-civilized, and civilized) birth was
intimately connected with supernatural beings, whence the origin
of numerous usages: the precautions taken to guard the woman
before delivery, the lustrations after the birth, the couvade, the
dread of menstrual and seminal discharges, and further, customs
relating to the arrival of boys and girls at the age of puberty.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_36" id="p_36">36</a></b>. At a later stage of culture the creation of the soul was distinguished
from that of the body, and was generally regarded as a
special act of the deity: the Hebrews conceived that the body was
fashioned out of dust, and that the breath of life was breathed into
it by God, so that man became a "living soul"<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>; Plato at one
time<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> thought that the soul of the world was created by God, out
of certain elements, before the body, and was made prior to it in
origin and excellence so that it should be its ruler, and that afterwards
he placed separate souls in the various separate bodies; the
immortal gods, says Cicero, have placed souls (<i>animos</i>) in human
bodies, and the human soul has been plucked (<i>decerptus</i>) from the
divine mind.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_37" id="p_37">37</a></b>. In the early Christian centuries the question of how the
soul came into the body was an intensely practical one&mdash;it was
closely connected with the question of man's inherent sinfulness
and his capacity for redemption. Tertullian's theory of the natural
propagation of souls (traducianism), which involved the inheritance
of a sinful nature, was succeeded on the one hand by the theory
of pre&euml;xistence (adopted by Origen from Plato), and on the other
hand by the view that every soul was an immediate creation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>God (creationism, held by Jerome and others), these both assuming
the natural goodness or untainted character of the soul at the birth
of the human being.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_38" id="p_38">38</a></b>. The mysterious character of death, the final departure of
the soul from the body, called forth in savage communities feelings
of awe and dread. As death, in the savage view, was due to the
intervention of a supernatural agency, the dead body and everything
connected with it partook of the sacredness that attached to
the supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Hence, probably, many of the customs relating
to the treatment of corpses&mdash;taboos that survived into comparatively
late times.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> The Old Testament ritual term 'unclean' is
used of corpses and other things that it was unlawful to touch,
things taboo, and in this sense is equivalent to 'sacred.'<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>


<h5>3. <span class="smcap">Polypsychism</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_39" id="p_39">39</a></b>. In the preceding section only the general fact of the existence
of the soul is considered. We find, however, a widespread belief
among savage and half-civilized peoples that every human body is
inhabited by several souls (two or more).<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Thus, the Fijians, the
Algonkins, and the Karens recognize two souls; the Malagasy,
the Dahomi, and the Ashanti three; the Congoans three or four,
the Chinese three, the Dakotas four, the Malays (of the peninsula)
seven; and this list is not exhaustive.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> To these various souls
different procedures and functions are assigned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span><b><a name="p_40" id="p_40">40</a></b>. In general, as to place and function during the man's life,
the following classes of souls are distinguished: the vital soul, or the
principle of life, whose departure leaves the man insensible or dead
(Malagasy <i>aina</i>, Karen <i>kalah</i>, E&#7811;e 'ghost-soul'); the dream-soul,
which wanders while the man is asleep (probably a universal conception
in early stages of culture); the shadow-soul, which accompanies
him by day (also, probably, universal); the reflection-soul
(similar to the preceding); the beast-soul, or bush-soul, incarnate in
a beast (among the Congoans, the E&#7811;e, the Tshi, the Khonds), with
which may be compared the Egyptian view that revenant souls and
Underworld shadows may assume the form of animals, and the
Hindu metempsychosis. A particular responsible moral soul is also
reported (among the Karens),<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> but it is doubtful whether this is
native; and still more doubtful are the Karen 'reason' (<i>ts&#333;</i>) and
the Khond beatified soul.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_41" id="p_41">41</a></b>. In regard to procedure after the man's death, it is generally
held in early stages of culture that one soul stays with the body,
or at the tomb, or in the village, or becomes air, while another departs
to the land of the dead (Fijians, Algonkins, and others), or is reborn
(Khonds), and in some cases a soul is said to vanish.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_42" id="p_42">42</a></b>. It is obvious that there was great flexibility and indefiniteness
in early theories of the soul. The savage mind, feeling its way
among its varied experiences, was disposed to imagine a separate
interior substance to account for anything that seemed to be a
separate and valuable manifestation of the man's personality. The
number of souls varies with the number of phenomena that it was
thought necessary to recognize as peculiar, and the lines of demarcation
between different souls are not always strictly drawn. As to
the manner of the souls' indwelling in the body, and as to their
relations one to another, savages have nothing definite to say, or, at
least, have said nothing. In general our information regarding savage
psychical theories is meager; it is not unlikely that with fuller acquaintance
the details given above would have to be modified, though
the general fact of polypsychism would doubtless remain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span><b><a name="p_43" id="p_43">43</a></b>. In the higher ancient religions there are only more or less
obscure indications of an earlier polypsychic system. The Egyptian
distinction between soul (<i>bai</i>), shadow (<i>haibet</i>), and double (<i>ka</i>)
appears to involve such a system; but the Egyptologists of the
present day are not agreed as to the precise interpretation of these
terms.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> The Semitic terms <i>nafs</i> and <i>ru&#7717;</i> (commonly rendered 'soul'
and 'spirit' respectively) are of similar origin, both meaning 'wind,'
'breath'; in the literature they are sometimes used in the same
sense, sometimes differentiated. The 'soul' is the seat of life,
appetite, feeling, thought&mdash;when it leaves the body the man swoons
or dies; it alone is used as a synonym of personality (a 'soul' often
means simply a 'person'). 'Spirit,' while it sometimes signifies the
whole nature, is also employed (like English 'spirit') to express the
tone of mind, especially courage, vigor. But, so far as the conception
of an interior being is concerned, the two terms are substantially
identical in the Semitic languages as known to us.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> And though,
as is noted above, 'spirit' is not used for the human personality, it
alone is the term in Hebrew for a class of subordinate supernatural
beings standing in close relations with the deity.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Greek literature
seems to know only one personal soul (<i>psyche</i>, with which <i>pneuma</i> is
often identical in meaning); a quality of nature (as in Semitic <i>ru&#7717;</i>)
is sometimes expressed by <i>pneuma</i> ('spirit').<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> The <i>thymos</i> appears
in Homer to be merely a function of the <i>psyche</i>,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> in any case it does
not represent a separate personality alongside of the <i>psyche</i>, and the
same thing is true of the <i>daimon</i>. Similarly, in Latin, <i>animus</i> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span><i>anima</i> are substantially synonyms<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>&mdash;<i>animus</i> sometimes expressing
tone of mind&mdash;and <i>spiritus</i> is equivalent to <i>ru&#7717;</i> and <i>pneuma</i>; the
individual <i>genius</i>, with its feminine representative the <i>juno</i>, is a
complicated and obscure figure, but it cannot be regarded as a
separate soul.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_44" id="p_44">44</a></b>. This variety of terms in the more advanced religions may
point to an early polypsychic conception. The tendency was, with
the progress of culture, to modify or efface this sort of conception.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
From a belief in a number of entities in the human interior being
men passed to a recognition of different sides or aspects of the
inward life, and finally to the distinct conception of the oneness of
the soul. The movement toward psychic unity may be compared
with the movement toward monotheism by the unification of the
phenomena of the external world.</p>


<h5>4. <span class="smcap">Future of the Soul</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_45" id="p_45">45</a></b>. Savage philosophy, recognizing the dual nature of man,
regarded death as due to the departure of the soul from the body.
The cessation of breathing at death was matter of common observation,
and the obvious inference was that the breath, the vital soul,
had left the body. Reflection on this fact naturally led to the question,
Whither has the soul gone?</p>

<p><b><a name="p_46" id="p_46">46</a></b>. <i>Death of the soul</i>. The general belief has always been that
the soul survived the man's death.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> There are, however, exceptions;
the continued existence of the soul was not an absolutely
established article in the savage creed. According to the reports of
travelers, it would seem that among some tribes there was disbelief
or doubt on this point. A West African native expressed his belief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>in the form of the general proposition, "The dead must die"; that is,
apparently, the dead man must submit to the universal law to which
the living are subject.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> In another African community some held
and others denied that a spirit could be killed, and one man was
certain that spirits lived long, but was not certain whether they ever
died.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Differences of opinion in regard to the fact of immortality
are said to exist in Banks Islands.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> The Eskimos are reported as
holding that the soul may be destroyed, and then, however, repaired.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_47" id="p_47">47</a></b>. It thus appears that even among low tribes there is speculation
on the question of the continuance of existence after earthly
death; there is admission of ignorance. We have, however, examples
of a definite belief in annihilation. In some cases, when the
theory of several souls is held,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> one of these souls is supposed to
become extinct at death: this is the case with the Malagasy <i>saina</i>,
and the 'beast-soul' among the E&#7811;e, Tshi, and Congoans; but
such a soul represents only a part of the man, and its disappearance
does not signify the extinction of the man's personality.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_48" id="p_48">48</a></b>. Complete extinction of the soul and the personality, in the
case of certain persons, is found among the Fijians: in the long
and difficult way to the Underworld, bachelors (as a rule), untattooed
women, false boasters, and those men who failed to overcome in
combat the "slayer of souls" (the god Sama) are killed and eaten.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
Something like this is reported of the Hervey Islands,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> New Zealand,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
the Hawaiians,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and other tribes. Among the wild tribes of India,
the Khonds and the Oraons, or Dhangars, hold to annihilation of
the soul in certain cases.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Miss Kingsley reports a specially interesting
view in Congo to the effect that souls die when the family
dies out.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> The ground of this sense of the solidarity of the living
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>and the dead is not clear; the most obvious explanation is that the
latter get their sustenance from the offerings of the former, and
perhaps from their prayers; such prayers, according to W. Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
are made in Polynesia. This belief appears also in some advanced
peoples: so the Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and apparently the Hindus.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_49" id="p_49">49</a></b>. In these cases no explanation is offered of how a soul can die.
Earthly death is the separation of the soul from the body, and by
analogy the death of a soul should involve a disruption of constituents,
but the savage imagination appears to have passed lightly over
this point: when a soul is eaten, it is destroyed as the human body
is destroyed when it is eaten; if it is drowned or clubbed, it dies as
a man does under similar treatment. The soul is conceived of as an
independent personality, with a corporeal form and mental powers;
the psychic body, it would seem, is endowed with power of thought.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_50" id="p_50">50</a></b>. This vagueness of conception enables us to understand how
savage logic reaches the conclusion that the soul may be mortal:
all the possibilities of the earthly person are transferred to it. In
regard to the occasion of its death, it is sometimes represented as
punishment for violation of tribal customs (as in Fiji), sometimes
as the natural fate of inferior classes of persons (as among the
Tongans, who are said to believe that only chiefs live after death),<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
sometimes as a simple destruction by human agency.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_51" id="p_51">51</a></b>. In the popular faith of the Semitic, Egyptian, Chinese, and
Indo-European peoples there is no sign of an extinction of the
personality after earthly death. The Babylonian dead all go to the
vast and gloomy Underworld (Aralu), where their food is dust, and
whence there is no return.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> The Old-Hebrew 'soul' (<i>nephesh</i>)
continues to exist in Sheol. True, its life is a colorless one, without
achievement, without hope, and without religious worship; yet it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>has the marks of personality.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> The fortunes of the spirit (<i>ru&#7717;</i>),
when it denotes not merely a quality of character but an entity,
are identical with those of the 'soul.'<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> In India, belief in life after
death has always been held by the masses, and philosophic systems
conceive of absorption, not of extinction proper. Zoroastrianism
had, and has, a well-developed doctrine of immortality, and the
Egyptian conception of the future was equally elaborate. In China
the cult of ancestors does not admit belief in annihilation.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> No
theory of annihilation is found in connection with the Greek and
Latin 'soul' and 'spirit' (<i>psyche, pneuma; animus, anima, spiritus</i>);
the <i>thymos</i> is not a separate entity, but only an expression of the
'soul';<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> and the Greek <i>daimon</i> and the Latin <i>genius</i> are too vague
to come into consideration in this connection.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_52" id="p_52">52</a></b>. Omitting the purely philosophical views of the nature and
destiny of the soul (absorption into the Supreme God, or the
Universal Force, is to be distinguished from annihilation), and
the belief of certain Christian sects in the future annihilation of the
wicked (based probably on a misunderstanding of certain Biblical
passages<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>), it may be said that the r&ocirc;le of the theory of extinction
of the soul in the general development of religion has been an
insignificant one. Beginning among the lowest tribes as an expression
of belief in the universality of mortality, it assumed a
punitive character in the higher savage creed, and was gradually
abandoned by the religions of civilized peoples.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_53" id="p_53">53</a></b>. The belief in the continued existence of the soul, on the
other hand, has maintained itself from the earliest known times to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>the present. The inquiry into the grounds of this survival belongs
to the history of the doctrine of immortality, and will not be pursued
here in detail.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Doubtless it has been the increasing sense of
the dignity of human nature, the conviction of the close connection
of human life with the divine, and the demand for a compensation
for the sufferings of the present (together with the instinctive desire
for continued existence) that has led men to retain faith in the
continued life of the soul. Modern beliefs in ghosts and in spiritualistic
phenomena testify to the persistence of this article of faith.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_54" id="p_54">54</a></b>. <i>Abode of the surviving soul.</i><a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Opinions regarding the destiny
of the surviving soul have changed from time to time in accordance
with topographical conditions and with changes in intellectual and
moral culture. There is no place or thing on or under or above the
ground that has not been regarded, at some time and by some communities,
as its abode. The selection of the particular thing or place
has been determined by local conditions&mdash;by what was supposed to
be observation of facts, or by what was conceived to be appropriate.
The obscurity of the subject has allowed free play to savage imagination.
The paucity of data makes it impossible to give a complete
statement of the views that have been held, or to arrange such as are
known in accurate chronological order; but the principal opinions may
be mentioned, following in a general way the order of refinement.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_55" id="p_55">55</a></b>. 1. One of the earliest (and also one of the most persistent)
views of the future of souls is that they are reborn or reincarnated
as human beings, or as beasts or plants or inanimate things. It
was not unnatural that, when a new human being came into the
world, it should be regarded as the reproduction of a former human
being, especially if the physiological conditions of birth were not
understood;<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> the basis of the belief may have been the general
similarity between human forms, and, in some cases, the special similarity
between the infant or the adult and some deceased person.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>An extension of the sphere of reincarnation would also naturally
arise from the recognized kinship between man and other things,
animate or inanimate.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_56" id="p_56">56</a></b>. Examples of these views are found in many parts of the
world. Tylor<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> and Marillier<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> have collected instances of such beliefs
among savage tribes in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania,
as well as in higher religions (Brahmanism, Buddhism, Plato, Mani,
the Jewish Kabbala, Swedenborg).<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Other instances of belief in
rebirth in human beings or in animals are found among the ancient
Germans,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> the people of Calabar,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> the Torres Straits islanders,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
the Central Australians,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and the Yorubans.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_57" id="p_57">57</a></b>. There is an obvious relation between the belief in reincarnation
in animal form and the worship of animals;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> both rest on
the assumption of substantial identity of nature between man and
other beings, an assumption which seems to be universal in early
stages of culture, and is not without support in modern philosophic
thought.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Ancient belief included gods in this circle of kinship&mdash;a
view that appears in Brahmanism and the later Buddhism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_58" id="p_58">58</a></b>. The higher forms of the theory introduced a moral element
into the process of reincarnation&mdash;the soul ascends or descends in
the scale of being according to the moral character or illumination
of its life on earth.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Thus it is given a practical bearing on everyday
life&mdash;a result that is in accordance with all religious history,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>in which we find that religious faith always appropriates and utilizes
the ethical ideas of its time.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_59" id="p_59">59</a></b>. At the present day the interest in the hypothesis of reincarnation
springs from its supposed connection with the doctrine of
immortality. Brahmanists and Buddhists maintain that it is the
only sure basis for this doctrine; but this view appears not to have
met with wide acceptance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_60" id="p_60">60</a></b>. 2. An all but universal belief among lower tribes is that departed
souls remain near their earthly abodes, haunting the neighborhood
of the body or the grave or the village.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> It is apparently
assumed that a soul is more at home in places which it knew in
its previous life, and this assumption is confirmed by sights and
sounds, chiefly during the night, that are interpreted as the forms
and utterances of wandering souls.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_61" id="p_61">61</a></b>. Generally no occupation is assigned to these ghosts, except
that it is sometimes supposed that they seek food and warmth:<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
scraps of food are left on the ground for them, and persons sitting
around a fire at night are afraid to venture into the dark places
beyond lest they meet them.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> For it is a common belief that such
souls are dangerous, having both the power and the will to inflict
injury.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> It is easy to see why they should be supposed to possess
extraordinary powers.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> The belief in their maliciousness may have
come naturally from the social conditions of the place and time:
in savage communities a man who is stronger than his fellows is
likely to treat them as his savage instincts prompt, to seize their
property or kill them; and departed souls would naturally be
credited with similar dispositions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_62" id="p_62">62</a></b>. It is also true that the mysterious is often dreadful; even
now in civilized lands there is a general fear of a 'ghost.' Precautions
are taken by savages to drive or keep the soul away: the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>doors of houses are closed, and noises are made. On the other hand,
ghosts, as members of the family or the clan, are often regarded as
friendly.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Even during a man's lifetime his soul may be a sort of
guide and protector&mdash;may attain, in fact, the rank of a deity;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and
after death it may become, as ancestor, the object of a regular cult.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_63" id="p_63">63</a></b>. Fear of ghosts has, perhaps, suggested certain methods of
disposing of the dead body, as by interring or exposing it at a distance
from the village, or burning it or throwing it into the water;
other considerations, however, as is suggested above,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> may determine,
in whole or in part, these methods of dealing with the body.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_64" id="p_64">64</a></b>. 3. It may be considered an advance in the organization of
the future life when the soul is supposed to go to some distant
place on the earth or in the sea or in the sky.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> This is an attempt
to separate the spheres of the living and the dead, and thus at
once to define the functions of the dead and relieve the living from
the fear of them. The land of the dead is sometimes vaguely
spoken of as lying on earth, far off in some direction not precisely
defined&mdash;east, west, north, or south&mdash;in accordance with traditions
whose origin is lost in the obscurity of the past.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_65" id="p_65">65</a></b>. Possibly in some cases it is the traditional original home of
the tribe;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> more often, it would seem, some local or astronomical
fact has given the suggestion of the place; one Egyptian view was
that the western desert (a wide mysterious region) was the abode
of the departed; it was a widespread belief that the dead went
to where the sun disappeared beneath the horizon.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> Tribes living
near the sea or a river often place the other world beyond the sea
or the river,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and a ferryman is sometimes imagined who sets souls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>over the water.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Mountains also are regarded as abodes of the
dead.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> It is not unnatural that the abodes of departed souls should
be placed in the sky, whose height and brightness, with its crowd
of luminous bodies, made it an object of wonder and awe, and
caused it to be regarded as the dwelling place of the happy gods,
with whom deserving men would naturally be. Sometimes the expanse
of the upper air was regarded as the home of souls (as in Samoa),
sometimes a heavenly body&mdash;the sun (in India), or the moon
(in the Bowditch Islands), or the stars.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The schemes being vague,
several of these conceptions may exist side by side at the same place
and time.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_66" id="p_66">66</a></b>. The occupations of the dead in these regions are held
usually to be the same as those of the living; no other view is
possible in early stages of social life. Generally all the apparatus
of earthly life (food, utensils, weapons) is placed on the grave or
with the body, and wives and slaves are slain to be the companions
of the deceased.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_67" id="p_67">67</a></b>. 4. A more decided separation between the living and the
dead is made in the conception of the underground world as the
abode of the latter. It was, however, only at a late period that this
conception was carried far enough to make the separation effective.
Among the Central Australians there were folk-stories of early
men who traveled under the ground, but this is represented as
merely an extraordinary way of getting from one place to another
on the surface of the earth. Some North American tribes tell of
an underground world inhabited by the ants and by beings similar
to man, but those who live up on the earth are seen there only by
accident, as when some hero dares the descent.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The conception
of a real subterranean or submarine hades is found, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>among many savage and barbarous peoples, as the Samoans, the
inhabitants of New Guinea, the Zulus, the Navahos, the Eskimo,
the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush, and others.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_68" id="p_68">68</a></b>. These pictures of the future world are crude, and usually
stand side by side with others; they are experiments in eschatology.
But the constructive imagination moved more and more
toward an organized underground hades as the sole abode of the
dead&mdash;the place to which all the dead go. Such a hades is found
among the civilized peoples of antiquity, Egyptians, Semites, Hindus,
Greeks, and Romans, and, in more recent times, among the
Teutons (Scandinavians). The suggestion for this position may
have come from the grave (though it does not appear that the
grave was regarded as the permanent abode of the dead), and from
caverns that seemed to lead down into the bowels of the earth.
The descent of souls into a subterranean world offered no difficulties
to early imagination: ghosts, like the Australian ancestors, could
move freely where living men could not go; where there was no
cavern like that by which &AElig;neas passed below,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> they could pass
through the ground.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_69" id="p_69">69</a></b>. A lower region offered a wide land for the departed, with the
possibility of organization of its denizens. Ghosts gradually lost their
importance as a factor in everyday life; sights and sounds that had
been referred to wandering souls came to be explained by natural
laws. Wider geographical knowledge made it difficult to assign the
ghosts a mundane home, and led to their relegation to the sub-mundane
region. Further, the establishment of great nations familiarized
men with the idea that every large community should have
its own domain. The gods were gradually massed, first in the sky,
the ocean, and hades, and then in heaven. For the dead the first
organization (if that term may be allowed) was in hades; the separation
into heaven and hell came later. A specific divine head of
the Underworld is found in Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria, India,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>Greece, Rome, but not in Israel. Such a definite system of government
could exist only when something approaching a pantheon had
been established; the Babylonians, for example, whose pantheon
was vague, had also a vague god of hades.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_70" id="p_70">70</a></b>. Theories of the occupations of the dead varied in the early
civilized stage, before the rise of the idea of ethical retribution in
the other life. In the absence of earthly relations, imagination could
conceive of nothing for them to do, and hence an ardent desire for
the continuance of earthly life.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> For the Hebrews the Underworld
was without pursuits; the shades sat motionless, in the dress and
according to the rank of the upper world, without emotions or aims
(except a sparkle of malicious satisfaction when some great man
came down from earth), and without religious worship.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> A similar
view was held by the Greeks and the Romans. Certain Egyptian
documents speak of mundane occupations for the dead, but these
documents belong to a comparatively late stage of culture, and what
the earlier view was we do not know.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Of Hindu ideas, also, on
this point we have only relatively late notices.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_71" id="p_71">71</a></b>. 5. A radical transformation in the conception of the state of
the dead was effected by the introduction of the idea of moral retribution
into the life of the Underworld.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> The basis of the movement
was the natural conception of life as determined by ethical considerations,
but the process of transformation has extended over thousands
of years and has hardly yet reached its completion. In the lowest eschatological
systems known to us there is no marked difference in the
status of departed souls; so among the Central Australians, the tribes
of New Guinea and the Torres Straits islands, the Zulus, the Malagasy,
the West African peoples, and some North American tribes.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span><b><a name="p_72" id="p_72">72</a></b>. The earliest grounds of distinction are ritualistic and social;
these occur among the higher savages and survive in some civilized
peoples. The Fijians assign punishment in the other world to
bachelors, men unaccompanied by their wives and children, cowards,
and untattooed women.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Where circumcision was a tribal mark, the
uncircumcised, as having no social status, were consigned to inferior
places in hades: so among the Hebrews.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The omission of proper
funeral ceremonies was held in like manner to entail deprivation of
privilege in hades: the shade had an undesirable place below, as
among the Babylonians and the Hebrews,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> or was unable to enter
the abode of the dead, and wandered forlorn on the earth or on the
border of the Underworld, as was the Greek belief.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Exposure of
the corpse to beasts and birds, making funeral ceremonies impossible,
was regarded as a terrible misfortune for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_73" id="p_73">73</a></b>. Such of these beliefs as relate to violations of ritual appear
to spring from the view that the tribal customs are sacred, and from
the consequent distinction between tribesmen and foreigners. All
persons without the tribal mark were shut out from the privileges
of the tribe, were outlaws in this world and the next; and those
whose bodies were not properly disposed of lost the support of
the tribal deities or of the subterranean Powers.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> It was also held
that the body retained the form in which it went down to hades;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
hence the widespread dread of mutilation, as among the Chinese
still. On the other hand the brave were rewarded.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_74" id="p_74">74</a></b>. Sometimes earthly rank determines future conditions&mdash;a
natural corollary to what is stated above (&sect;72 f.). A distinction is
made between nobles and common people in the Bowditch Islands.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
The members of the Fijian Areoi Society are held to enjoy special
privileges in the other world.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> The belief in the Marquesas Islands is
that the sky is for high gods and nobles.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> According to John Smith,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>in savage Virginia only nobles and priests were supposed to survive
after death.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The North American Mandans (of Dakota), according
to one view, assign to the brave in the hereafter the delightful
villages of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> When souls are supposed to enter into animals
different animals are assigned to nobles and common men.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Kings
and nobles retain their superiority of position and are sometimes
attended by their slaves and officers.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_75" id="p_75">75</a></b>. The manner of death is sometimes significant. The Karens
hold that persons killed by elephants, famine, or sword, do not enter
the abode of the dead, but wander on the earth and take possession
of the souls of men.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> In Borneo it is supposed that those who are
killed in war become specters.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The belief in the Marquesas Islands
is that warriors dying in battle, women dying in childbirth, and
suicides go up to the sky.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> In regard to certain modes of death
opposite opinions are held in the Ladrone (Marianne) Islands and
the Hervey group: in the former those who die by violence are
supposed to be tortured by demons, those who die a natural death
are believed to be happy; according to the view in the latter group
these last are devoured by the goddess of death, and the others are
happy. In the one case violent death, it would seem, is supposed to
be due to the anger of the gods, and to be a sign of something bad
in the man; in the other case happiness is compensation for the misfortune
of a violent death, and natural death, being the fate of ordinary
people, leaves one at the mercy of the mistress of the other world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_76" id="p_76">76</a></b>. The advance to the conception of moral retribution hereafter
could take place only in communities in which earthly life
was organized on a moral basis. The beginning of the movement is
seen in certain savage tribes. Savages have their codes, which generally
recognize some ethical virtues among the tribal obligations.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>Stealing, lying, failure in hospitality, cowardice, violation of marital
rights&mdash;in general, all the acts that affect injuriously the communal
life&mdash;are, as a rule, condemned by the common sense of
the lowest peoples, and the moral character of the gods reflects that
of their worshipers. By reason of the sense of solidarity the faults
of individuals affect not only themselves but also their communities,
and the gods care for communities as well as for individuals. Whenever,
then, there is an inquest in the other world, these faults, it is
likely, will be punished. On account of the paucity of our information,
it is not possible to make a general statement on this point,
but examples of future moral control occur in many savage creeds.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
In such systems the nature of the life beyond the grave is variously
conceived: sometimes as cheerless and gloomy (as in Finland),
sometimes as pleasant (as in Samoa, New Guinea, New Caledonia,
Bowditch Islands, some North American tribes, Brazil).<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_77" id="p_77">77</a></b>. In tracing the growth of the conception of distinctions in
the other world,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> we find first a vague opinion that those who do
badly in this life are left to shift for themselves hereafter;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> that
is, there is no authority controlling the lives of men below. In the
majority of cases, however, distinctions are made, but these, as is
remarked above, are based on various nonmoral considerations,
and have small cultural value.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_78" id="p_78">78</a></b>. In the published reports of savage beliefs there is not always
mention of a formal examination of the character of the dead, and
probably nothing of the sort was imagined by the lowest tribes. It
appears, however, in such relatively advanced peoples as the Fijians<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
and the Khonds.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span><b><a name="p_79" id="p_79">79</a></b>. Moral retribution proper is found only in great civilized
nations and not in all of them; the early Semites appear to have
retained the old conception of punishment for ritual faults or failures,
and for offenses against the national welfare. For the Hebrews
the proof is found in the Old Testament passim; in the Babylonian
and Assyrian literature, as far as published, there is one sign of
departure from the scheme sketched in the <i>Descent of Ishtar</i>:
Hammurabi (ca. 2000 B.C.) invokes the curses of the gods on
any one who shall destroy the tablet of his penal code, and wishes
that such a one may be deprived of pure water after death. In
regard to the South Arabians, the pre-Mohammedan North Arabians,
and the Aram&aelig;ans, we have no information; and for the Ph&oelig;nicians
there is only the suggestion involved in the curse invoked
on those who violate a tomb, and in the funeral ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> But
the same general religious ideas prevailed throughout the ancient
Semitic area, and we may probably assume that the Hebrew conception
was the universal one.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_80" id="p_80">80</a></b>. In Egypt, India, China, Persia, Greece, Rome, however, and
among the Jews in the Greek period,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> higher ethical conceptions
were carried over to the Underworld; judgment, it was held, was
pronounced on the dead, and rewards and punishments dealt out
to them according to their moral character. The Jews and the
Persians went a step further, and conceived of a final general
judgment, a final winding-up of human history, and a permanent
reconstruction of the world on a basis largely moral, though tinged
with local religious elements&mdash;a grandiose idea that has maintained
itself up to the present time, embodying the conviction that the
outcome of life depends on character, and that ethical retribution
is the essence of the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span><b><a name="p_81" id="p_81">81</a></b>. This ethical constitution of the life hereafter led to the local
separation of the good from the bad. Such a separation was imagined
by comparatively undeveloped peoples whose ethical principle was
chiefly ritualistic, as, for example, the Fijians, the American Indians,
and by civilized peoples in their early stages, the Vedic Hindus<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
(Yama's abode in the sky, and a pit) and the Greeks (the Homeric
Elysian Fields, and Tartarus).<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_82" id="p_82">82</a></b>. In fact, a recognition of a place of happiness and a place of
punishment in the other life accompanies sooner or later a certain
stage of ethical culture in all communities. In India it appears in
the late Vedic and post-Vedic periods, together with the ethical
doctrine of metempsychosis, and though, as is natural in such a
stage of development, various ideas are held respecting the destinies
of the good and the bad, the ethical distinction between these classes
of persons, with a systematic awarding of rewards and punishments,
becomes firmly established: Yama becomes an ethical judge. In the
Brahmanas, Manu, and the Mahabharata, we find a sort of heaven
for the virtuous and a hell for the vicious. While the academic
thought of Brahmanism and the altruistic systems of Jainism and
Buddhism looked to the absorption of the departed into the All,
the popular Hindu faith held fast to the scheme of happiness and
wretchedness in the future.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> As in Dante's <i>Divina Commedia</i>, the
heaven was somewhat colorless, the hell more distinct and picturesque;
pain is acute and varied, happiness is calm and uniform.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_83" id="p_83">83</a></b>. The later Egyptian eschatological development was not unlike
the later Hindu. The good were rewarded with delightful habitations
in the West or with the Sun; the bad were tortured in a gloomy place.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span><b><a name="p_84" id="p_84">84</a></b>. As regards the early Greek eschatological scheme, it is
suggested by S. Reinach<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> that the descriptions of punishments in
Tartarus (as in the cases of Tantalus and others) arose from misunderstood
representations of the condition of the dead in the other
world, they being represented either as engaged in the occupations
of this life, or as they were at the moment of death. The great
punishments, in fact, are assigned only to heroic mythical offenders,
but there seems to be no reason why the idea of retribution should
not be supposed to enter into such descriptions. Separation of the
good from the bad on ethical grounds appears in Greece in the
time of Plato. In various passages he describes the savage places
(Tartarus and others) to which criminals go after death, and the
happy abodes of the virtuous.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> These abodes were not with the
gods; the occasional translations to heaven (Heracles, Ganymede)
are exceptional honors paid to heroes and favorites.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_85" id="p_85">85</a></b>. The Jewish conception of a punitive future belongs to the
Greek period of Jewish history, and was probably developed on
Hebrew lines under Greek and Egyptian influence. A combination
of the Old Testament view of future retribution on earth with the
conception of torture in the other world is given in Enoch.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> In
some circles Sheol was placed in the West and divided into two
regions, one of happiness, the other of punishment,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> or the good
dwell with the angels in heaven, the bad in hell.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> By others the
abodes of the dead were placed in the heavenly regions: of the
seven heavens, the second was assigned to the bad and the third
to the good.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> With all the variation of locality, the separation of the
bad from the good is made permanent, and this distinction is maintained
in the New Testament, which throughout assigns the wicked
to hell (Gehenna or Tartarus), while the righteous dwell sometimes
on the renovated earth, sometimes in the heavenly regions.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span><b><a name="p_86" id="p_86">86</a></b>. The Jewish and Christian books mentioned above content
themselves with the general statement that the punishment of the
wicked will be torture by fire and cold. Succeeding Christian books
elaborated the picture of torture with great ingenuity; the <i>Apocalypse
of Peter</i>, following and expanding the description of Plato
and Enoch, has an elaborate barbarous apparatus of punishment,
and this scheme, continued through a series of works,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> has its
culmination in Dante's Inferno, where, however, the ethical element
is pronounced, though colored by the poet's likes and dislikes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_87" id="p_87">87</a></b>. <i>Purgatory</i>. The wicked dead were not always left hopeless
in their place of punishment. Kindly human feeling (shown in
early stages by pious care for the well-being of the dead) and the
analogy of earthly procedures, civil and religious, led to the view
that, after the expiation of faults by suffering, the evildoer might
be freed from his prison and gain a place of happiness. Pardon
and purification were effected on earth by punishments (scourging,
imprisonment, etc.) or by ritual processes (ablution, fastings, etc.)&mdash;why
not in the other life? In some systems of transmigration
the man, forced after death to assume a lower form, may rise by
good conduct to a higher form. In Plato's imaginative construction
of the Underworld<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> those who have lived neither well nor ill are
purified in the Acherusian lake and then receive rewards according
to their deserts; and those who have committed great but not
unpardonable crimes may come to the lake (after having suffered
the pains of Tartarus) and be freed from trouble if they obtain
pardon from those they have wronged. But as here, so hereafter,
certain offenses were regarded as unpardonable. The purgatorial
conception passed into patristic and Roman and Eastern Christianity
and Talmudic and Medieval Judaism.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_88" id="p_88">88</a></b>. <i>Resurrection</i>. The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead,
which has been fully developed only by the Persians and the Jews
(and from them taken by Christianity and Islam), appears to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>grown from simple beginnings. It is the expression of the conviction
that the perfect man is made up of soul and body, and its
full form is found only in periods of high ethical culture. But in
very early times the belief in the intimate connection between body
and soul appears in the care taken among certain peoples to preserve
the bones or the whole body of the deceased as a possible
future abode for the soul;<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and, on the other hand, as the soul, it
was held, might return to the body and be dangerous to the living,
means were sometimes employed to frighten it off. It seems to
have been believed in some cases that the destruction of the body
involved the destruction of the soul (New Zealand). An actual
entrance of a departed soul into a human body is involved in some
early forms of the doctrine of reincarnation,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> but this is not the
restoration of the dead man's own body. It was held in Egypt
(and not improbably elsewhere) that the soul after death might
desire to take possession of its own body, and provision was made
for such an emergency; but this belief seems not to have had
serious results for religious life. A temporary reunion of soul and
body appears in the figure of the vampire, which, however, is a
part of a popular belief and religiously not important. But these
passing beliefs indicate a general tendency, and may have paved
the way for the more definite conception of bodily restoration.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_89" id="p_89">89</a></b>. The more developed Hindu doctrine (Brahmanic, Jainistic,
Buddhistic) recognized a great variety of possible forms of reincarnation
(human and nonhuman), and made a step forward by
including the continuity or re&euml;stablishment of moral life and responsibility
(the doctrine of karma).<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> It, however, never reached
the form of a universal or partial resurrection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span><b><a name="p_90" id="p_90">90</a></b>. The birthplace of this latter doctrine appears to have been
the region in which Mazdaism arose, the country south of the
Caspian Sea. Windischmann infers from Herodotus, iii, 62, that it
appears as a Mazdean belief as early as the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> This
is doubtful, but it is reported as a current belief by Theopompus.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
Its starting-point was doubtless the theory of reincarnation, which,
we may suppose, the Iranian Aryans shared with their Indian
brethren. Precisely what determined the Iranian movement toward
this specific form of reincarnation we have no means of knowing.
It may be due to the same genius for simple organization that led
the Zoroastrians to discard the mass of the old gods and elevate
Ahura Mazda to the chief place in the pantheon; their genius for
practical social religious organization may have induced them to
select human reincarnation as the most natural and the most
effective morally, and to discard other forms as unworthy.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> The
dead man's own body would then be the natural dwelling place of
his soul; but a refined body (as in 1 Cor. xv) might be regarded
as better suited to the finer life of the future. Whatever the
cause, they adopted this conception, and probably through their influence
it passed to, or was formulated by, the Jews, among whom
it appears in the second century B.C. (in the Book of Daniel).<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> In
Daniel and 2 Maccabees resurrection is confined to the Jews; in
Enoch it is sometimes similarly confined, sometimes apparently
universal.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> In the New Testament also the same diversity of statement
appears; resurrection seems to be confined to believers in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>passages<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> and to be universal in others.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> In the former case it is
regarded as a reward of piety and as a consequence of the intimate
relation between the man and God or Christ; unbelievers then remain
in hades, where they are punished. But universal resurrection
was probably thought of as involved in the grandiose conceptions
of a final judgment and a final moral restoration.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>


<h5>5. <span class="smcap">Powers of the Soul</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_91" id="p_91">91</a></b>. Savage lore takes account of the powers of the separated
soul only; the qualities and functions of the earthly incorporate
soul are accepted as a part of the existing familiar order, and are
not analyzed or discussed. It was different with the departed soul,
which, because of its strangeness and mystery, was credited with
extraordinary powers, and this part of savage science was gradually
developed, through observation and inference, into an important
system. In the search for causes, the Shade, its independent existence
once established, came to be regarded as the agent in many
procedures of which no probable account could otherwise be given.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_92" id="p_92">92</a></b>. The greatest activity of the departed soul is found in the
earliest known period of culture, when it was not yet relegated to
hades or to the sky, but dwelt on earth, either near its former habitation
or in a distant region from which it might return. Its powers
of movement and action are then held to be all that imagination
can suggest. Such souls move through the air or under the ground,
enter houses through obstacles impenetrable to the earthly man,
pass into the human body, assume such shapes as pleases them.
Divested of gross earthly bodies, they are regarded as raised above
all ordinary limitations of humanity. Of these conceptions, that of
the ghost's superhuman power of movement remains in the popular
faith to the present day.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_93" id="p_93">93</a></b>. The practical question for the early man is the determination
of the relation of departed souls to earthly life. Among savage
tribes their attitude is sometimes friendly, sometimes unfriendly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>more often the latter.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> To fear the unknown is a human instinct.
Shades are looked on as aliens, and aliens are generally enemies.
In particular, ghosts are conceived of as sometimes wandering
about in search of food or warmth, or as cherishing enmity toward
persons who had wronged them in their earthly life. They are
supposed to be capable of inflicting disease or pain, and precautions
are taken against them. Cases are reported of persons who
killed themselves in order that, as ghosts, they might wreak vengeance
on enemies.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> On the other hand, to the members of its own
family the departed soul is sometimes held to be friendly, or not
unfriendly, but among savages it is not thought of as a potent and
valuable friend.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_94" id="p_94">94</a></b>. In the more advanced cults the functions of the departed
souls become larger and more important. They are regarded as
having the power of foretelling the future, and are consulted.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> They
become guardian spirits, and a cult of souls arises.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> In some higher
forms of religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) they are regarded
as mediators between man and the deity, or as advocates for man
in the heavenly court.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_95" id="p_95">95</a></b>. <i>Prayer for the dead.</i> Before the ethical stage of religion the
moral condition and needs of the dead did not come into consideration;
their physical wants were met by performance of funeral
rites and by supplying them with food and other necessities of life,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
and they later came to be looked on as helpers rather than as needing
help; but when this old view passed away, and the conceptions
of judgment and ethical retribution after death were reached, the
moral status of the dead became a source of anxiety to the living.
It was held that the divine judge might be reached&mdash;by intercession
or by petitions, or by the performance of certain ceremonies&mdash;and
his attitude toward the dead modified.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span><b><a name="p_96" id="p_96">96</a></b>. A trace of such care for the deceased may be found in the
Brahmanic ceremonies intended to secure complete immortality to
fathers.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> In Egypt, in the later times, there was an arrangement
for securing for the deceased immunity from punishment for moral
offenses: a sacred beetle of stone, inscribed with a charm beginning
"O my heart, rise not up against me as a witness," laid on the
breast of the mummy, silences the heart in the presence of Osiris,
and the man, even though guilty, goes free. Forms of charms were
prepared by the priests, and the name of any one who could pay
was inserted in blanks left for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> This sort of corrupting
procedure was reproduced in some periods of Christianity. In
the early Church a custom existed of receiving baptism on behalf
of such as died unbaptized;<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> here, apparently, a magical efficacy
was ascribed to the act. The first mention of prayer for the dead
occurs in a history of the Maccabean wars, where a sin-offering,
accompanied by prayer, effects reconciliation for certain soldiers
who died in a state of sin (idol symbols were found on their persons).<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
Prayer for the dead has been largely developed in Christianity
and Islam.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>


<h5>6. <span class="smcap">Genesis of Spirits</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_97" id="p_97">97</a></b>. As early science identified life with the soul, it logically attributed
a soul to everything that was regarded as living. This category
seems to have embraced all the objects of the world&mdash;human beings,
beasts, plants, weapons, rocks, waters, heavenly bodies. Savages
rarely formulate their ideas on such a subject, but the belief in
the future existence of nonhuman as well as human things is fairly
established by the widespread practice of slaying animals at the
tomb and burying with the dead the objects they are supposed to
need in the other world. This custom exists among many tribes at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>the present day, and the contents of ancient tombs prove its existence
in former times. The dead are provided with clothing, implements
of labor, weapons, ornaments, food, and as these objects
remain in their mundane form by or in the grave, it is held that
their souls pass with the souls of their possessors into the world
beyond. Further, the belief in transformation from human to nonhuman
forms and vice versa involves the supposition of life in all
such things. That the heavenly bodies, similarly, are supposed to
be animated by souls appears from the fact that they are regarded
as manlike in form, thought, and manner of life: the sun is frequently
represented as a venerable man who traverses the sky&mdash;the moon
being his wife, and the stars their children; and sun and moon
sometimes figure as totems. This general conception has been expanded
and modified in a great variety of ways among different
peoples, but the belief in the anthropomorphic nature of the astral
bodies has been an element of all religions except the highest.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_98" id="p_98">98</a></b>. The apparent incongruities in the savage theory&mdash;that all
things are endowed with life&mdash;need occasion us no difficulty. Complete
consistency and tenability in such theories is not to be expected.
Early men, like the lower animals, were doubtless capable of distinguishing
between things living and things dead: a dog quickly
discovers whether a moving object is alive. Man and beasts have
in such questions canons of criticism derived from long experience.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_99" id="p_99">99</a></b>. But man differs from the beast in that he feels the necessity
of accounting for life by the hypothesis of a soul, and as he seems
to himself to find evidence of life in plants and minerals (movement,
growth, decay), he is justified in attributing souls to all things. He
is interested, however, only in movements that affect his welfare.
Whatever his general theory about rocks, a particular rock, as long
as it does not affect his life, is for him an inert and worthless mass,
practically dead; but if he discovers that it has power to harm him,
it becomes instinct with life, and is treated as a rational being. Man
has shown himself practical in all stages of religion; he is always the
center of his world, and treats objects and theories with sole regard
to his own well-being.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_100" id="p_100">100</a></b>. The world of the savage was thus peopled with souls, and
these came to have an independent existence. That this was the
case with human souls is pointed out above,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and by analogy the
separateness was extended to all souls. Thus there arose tree-spirits,
river-spirits, and other similar extrahuman beings. It is convenient
to employ the term 'spirit' as the designation of the soul
in a nonhuman object, isolated and independent, and regarded as
a Power to be treated with respect. The term is sometimes used
of a disembodied human soul, and sometimes of a deity resident in
an object of nature. It is better to distinguish, as far as possible,
between these different senses of the word. The functions of a
spirit are sometimes practically identical with those of a god. The
difference between these two classes of extrahuman agents is one of
general culture; it is especially determined in any community by
the extent of the organization of such agents that has been effected
by the community. The cult of spirits is considered below in connection
with the description of divine beings.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>EARLY RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_101" id="p_101">101</a></b>. The earliest known forms of social life are characterized
by the performance of public ceremonies, which are almost always
religious. Religion in some form enters into all the details of early
life&mdash;there is no event that is not supposed to be caused or affected
by a supernatural Power or influence. A vaguely conceived force
(<i>mana</i>), an attribute of life, is believed to reside in all things, and
under certain circumstances has to be reckoned with. Mysterious
potencies in the shape of souls, spirits, gods, or mana are held
to preside over and control all affairs&mdash;birth, sickness, death, hate
and love, hunting and war, sowing and reaping. There is no dogma
except belief in this extrahuman influence&mdash;no conception of moral
effort as based on and sanctioned by a definite moral ideal, no
struggle of the sort that we call spiritual. Religion consists of a
body of practices whose authority rests on precedent; as it is supposed
they have existed from time immemorial, they are held to be
necessary to secure the well-being of the tribe (a sufficient supply
of food, or victory over enemies); to the question why such and such
things are done, the common reply of the savage is that without
them the thing desired could not be got.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_102" id="p_102">102</a></b>. In the earliest stages known to us these procedures are
already elaborate and distinct; they are generally conducted by the
tribal leaders (old men, chiefs, magicians), by whom they are handed
down from generation to generation.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Their precise origin is lost
in the depths of antiquity. Doubtless they arose from social needs,
and their precise forms were suggested by crude observation and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>reasoning. Reflection on processes of nature, guided sometimes by
fortunate or unfortunate accidents, may have led to the establishment
of methods of procedure for gaining social and individual ends;
and, as at this formative period the whole life of the community
was permeated by religious conceptions, the procedures either
were originally religious or speedily took on a religious coloring.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_103" id="p_103">103</a></b>. Two characteristics belong to early ceremonies: they are
communal, and they are generally sacred mysteries. Whatever be
the origin of the tribal and clan institutions of society, these are
practically universal in the world as it is now known. Even in the
few cases where men live in the comparative isolation of individual
family groups (as the Eskimo, Fuegians, and others are said to
do<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>), there is a communal feeling that is shown in the identity of
customs and ideas among the isolated groups. In early man there
is little individuality of thought or of religious experience,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> and
there is no observable difference between public and private religious
worship. Ceremonies, like language, are the product of
social thought, and are themselves essentially social. When a man
performs an individual religious act (as when he recognizes an omen
in an animal or bird, or chooses a guardian animal or spirit, or
wards off a sickness or a noxious influence), he is aware that his
act is in accordance with general usage, that it has the approval of
the community, and that its potency rests on the authority of the
community. It is true that such communal character belongs, in
some degree, to all religious life&mdash;no person's religion is wholly
independent of the thought of his community; but in the lower
strata the acceptance of the common customs is unreflective and
complete. When definite individualism sets in, ceremonies begin to
lose their old significance, though they may be retained as mere
forms or with a new interpretation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span><b><a name="p_104" id="p_104">104</a></b>. That the ceremonial observances are usually sacred is obvious
from all the descriptions we have of them. Their power is
not always attributed to the action of external personal, supernatural
agencies (though such agencies may have been assumed originally);
in many cases, it is held to reside in themselves.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> They are sacred
in the sense that they are mysterious, acting in a way that is
beyond human comprehension and with a power that is beyond
human control.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> They are efficacious only when performed by
persons designated or recognized by the community. Here there
is undoubtedly a dim sense of law and unity in the world, based on
an interpretation of experiences. This is a mode of thought that
runs through the whole history of religion&mdash;only, in the earliest
stages of human life, it is superficial and narrow. The earlier
ceremonial customs contain the germs and the essential features
of the later more refined procedures.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_105" id="p_105">105</a></b>. Without attempting to give an exhaustive list, the principal
early ceremonies may be divided into classes as follows:</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Emotional and Dramatic Ceremonies</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_106" id="p_106">106</a></b>. The dances that are so common among savage tribes are in
many instances now (and doubtless this has always been the case)
simply the expression of animal joyousness.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> They are like the
caperings of young animals&mdash;only, the human feeling of rhythm
asserts itself, the movements are often measured and graceful.
There is naturally an accompaniment of noise&mdash;shouting and
beating on pieces of wood, bone, or metal, with songs or chants,
the beginnings of vocal and instrumental music.</p>

<p>Words and melodies are simple and rude; they are the productions
of individual singers, often, of course, made from a stock
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>of material common to all members of the clan or the tribe. In
Australia songs are thought to be obtained by bards during sleep
from the souls of the dead (sometimes from Bunjil), or the bard
is possessed by the soul of a beast; chants are employed in magical
ceremonies, and there are lullabies and other children's songs.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> The
Muscogee "Song of the Sabbea" is very sacred.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> In West Africa
minstrels recite song-stories, every story being attached to an object
(bone, feather, etc.).<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Songs are chanted at festivals in Guiana (and
at night men tell endless stories).<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_107" id="p_107">107</a></b>. The movements of the dance are sometimes in imitation
of those of animals,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> sometimes spontaneous, and sometimes from
our point of view indecent. The indecency and obscenity originated
and has continued in a period when no moral element entered into
such performances&mdash;they simply follow animal instincts and impulses,
are controlled by them, and appear usually not to affect the
customs relating to marriage and chastity (so in the Areoi festivities
of Tahiti, and among the Central Australians<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_108" id="p_108">108</a></b>. In accordance with the law by which religion appropriates
social customs, the dance is devoted to religious purposes
and acquires a sacred character.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> It is a common ceremony as a
preparation for war: the warriors of the tribe jump about with
violent gesticulations and shouts, brandishing weapons and mimicking
the acts of attacking and slaying enemies.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Here, doubtless, the
object is partly to excite the men to fury and thus prepare them
for combat, but there is also the conviction that the ceremony itself
has a sacred potency.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> A similar occult power is attached to dancing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>in Timorlaut, where, when a ship is at sea, the girls sing and dance
on the beach daily to bring the men back.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> There are dances in
commemoration of the dead<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>&mdash;apparently a combination of affection
and homage, with the general purpose of conciliating the departed
and procuring their aid; the belief being, apparently, that
the dead see these demonstrations and are pleased with them. A
Ghost Dance formerly performed in California had for its object
bringing back the dead.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_109" id="p_109">109</a></b>. At a later time such ceremonies were connected with the
worship of gods: sometimes they were of the nature of offerings of
homage to the supernatural Powers, as in the Young Dog Dance;<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
sometimes they took on a symbolic and representative or dramatic
character. Among the Redmen the dramatic dances are elaborate,
often representing the histories of divine persons, these latter frequently
appearing in the form of animals.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> The accompanying
songs or chants relate stories that are intended to explain, wholly
or in part, the details of the rite.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_110" id="p_110">110</a></b>. Thus combined with other ceremonies, dances become important
means of religious culture. In Greece dances were connected
with many cults, among others with the Dionysiac ceremonies, out
of which grew the Greek drama. Among the Hebrews the ancient
ceremonial dance appears as late as the time of David,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> though it
was then, perhaps, falling into desuetude, since his wife, Michal, is
disgusted at his procedures. The violent movement of the dance
excites not only warlike rage but also religious ecstasy, and has
been used abundantly for this purpose by magicians, prophets, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>mystics; the performer is regarded as a vehicle of divine revelation,
all abnormal excitement being ascribed to possession by a spirit.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_111" id="p_111">111</a></b>. With dances may be classed processions, in which usually a
god is invoked or praised. In Ashantiland, in time of war, when
the men are with the army, processions of women, wives of the
warriors, march through the streets, invoking the gods on behalf
of the absent men.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> Often the performers bear a sacred object,
as a stone (sometimes inclosed in a box<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>), a boat, or an image; in
early times such objects not only represent the gods but actually
embody them, or are themselves superhuman Powers.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_112" id="p_112">112</a></b>. A peculiar form of procession is that in which the worshipers
move round a sacred object, perhaps the adoption of a
natural form of play. The original design in such movements may
have been simply to show respect to the object in question and
secure its favor, the circular movement being a natural way of
keeping in touch with it. In certain cases the circumambulation is
connected with the movement of the sun in the sky&mdash;probably a
later interpretation of the ceremony. Examples are found in Hindu,
Greek, and Roman practices, and in some modern Christian usages
(in the Greek and Roman churches). As a magical efficiency was held
to attach to the ceremony, its effect was sometimes held to depend
on the direction of the movement; if it was to the right&mdash;passing
from east through south to west (the worshiper facing the east)&mdash;it
was good, but bad if in the opposite direction. Though traces of
solemn circumambulation are found in some lower tribes, it has
been, and is, practiced chiefly in the higher cults.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_113" id="p_113">113</a></b>. Sacred dances and processions are natural human expressions
of emotions that have been adopted by religious sentiment,
and are often supposed to have potency in themselves. They tend
to disappear with the progress of general refinement and of ethical
conceptions of life and of deity. They continue, however, far into
the civilized period, in which we find dramatic representations (as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>the Eleusinian rites and the medieval Mystery Plays), processions
of priests bearing or conducting sacred objects, processions of
devotees with music, and pilgrimages to shrines. Such ceremonies,
while they are regarded by educated persons simply as expressions
of reverence and accompaniments of prayer, are still believed by
many to have an innate or magic potency, insuring prosperity
to the participants.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Decorative and Curative Ceremonies</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_114" id="p_114">114</a></b>. Love of ornament is found among all savage peoples; the
value they attach to beads and all colored things is well known to
travelers and traders. It has been plausibly argued that the origin
of clothing is to be found in the desire of each sex to make itself
beautiful in the eyes of the other.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> However that may be, the
employment of leaves for headdresses and waistbands is general
among lower tribes.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_115" id="p_115">115</a></b>. Equally popular is the adornment of the body by colored
marks made with red ocher, pipe-clay, turmeric, charcoal, and such
like things as are furnished by nature. Elaborate designs, of straight
and curved lines, are traced on the skin, and these are gradually
differentiated and become marks of rank and function. The war
paint of the American Indians is governed by fixed rules, the object
being to make the warrior terrible to enemies.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Rings, quills, sticks,
and stones, worn in holes made in ears, nose, lips, and cheeks,
are all originally decorative; and so also prickings and gashes in
the body, often in regular outlines.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_116" id="p_116">116</a></b>. These latter, made according to tribal custom and law, become
tribal marks (tattoo), and are then essential to one's standing
in the community. This custom is general in Polynesia and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>parts of North America.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> The use of oil and other unguents early
established itself as a custom of savage society. They were probably
useful in a variety of ways. For the hair they made up for the
absence of comb and brush; in combat they enabled the warrior
to slip from the grasp of his enemy; they defended the naked
body from rain, and from soiling and injury produced by contact
with the earth and hard bodies; and in sickness they were regarded
as curative.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> Oil was abundantly used as an article of food.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_117" id="p_117">117</a></b>. All these materials of decoration are transferred to the service
of religion. The headdress becomes a mask to represent an animal
in a sacred ceremony,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> or a priestly tiara. In such ceremonies
(especially in those of initiation) the painting of the body plays an
important part, the traceries varying according to the thing represented
and the symbolism of the action.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> It is often difficult to see
the precise significance of the paintings, but in certain cases they are
totemic marks, and represent whatever is sacred in totemic belief.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_118" id="p_118">118</a></b>. It is possible to construe the development in two ways: the
paintings may be regarded as originally totemic or other clan marks,
and as afterwards employed as ornaments, or the order of movement
may be taken to be in the reverse direction; but when we
consider the primitive character of decoration, the second suggestion
seems the more probable. The same remark applies to the
practice of pricking, scarring, and tattooing.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> For the body-markings
blood is sometimes employed, perhaps in part on account of its
decorative color, but also probably with a religious significance.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span><b><a name="p_119" id="p_119">119</a></b>. Decoration has been and is largely employed in structures
and dress connected with religious life. Posts and beams of houses,
totem posts and masts of vessels are covered with figures in which
artistic feeling is discernible;<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> and in late periods all the resources
of art are devoted to the form and adornments of temples, altars,
and images. The designs are taken from familiar objects, mostly
from plants and animals. The ultimate motive is love of ornament,
which, while it finds abundant expression in ordinary social
life, has its greatest development in religion&mdash;a natural result of
the fact that in a large part of human history religion has been the
chief organizing factor of society.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_120" id="p_120">120</a></b>. The tendency has been to make the dress of ministers
of religion ornate.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> This tendency has arisen partly from love of
ornament, and partly, doubtless, it is the transference of court
customs to religious ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_121" id="p_121">121</a></b>. Symbolism has entered largely into religious decoration.
In very early times figures of animals, plants, and human beings
were used as records of current events, and were sometimes supposed
to have magical power, the picture being identified with the
thing represented. In a more advanced stage of culture the transition
was easy to the conception of the figures as representing
ideas, but the older conception is often found alongside of the
later&mdash;a symbolical signification is attached to pictures of historical
things. These then have a spiritual meaning for higher minds,
while for the masses they may be of the nature of fetishes.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> In
both cases they may serve a good purpose in worship by fixing
the mind on sacred things.</p>


<h5><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span><span class="smcap">Economic Ceremonies</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_122" id="p_122">122</a></b>. The first necessity of savages is a sufficient supply of food,
and this, they hold, is to be procured either by the application of
what they conceive to be natural laws, or by appeal to superhuman
Powers. Among economic ceremonies, therefore, we may distinguish
those which may be loosely described as natural, those in
which a supernatural element enters, and those in which the two
orders of procedure appear to be combined.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_123" id="p_123">123</a></b>. Savages are generally skillful hunters. They know how
to track game, to prepare nets and pits, and to make destructive
weapons. The African pygmies have poisoned arrows, with which
they are able to kill the largest animals.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> The people of British
New Guinea organize hunts on a large scale.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> In Australia, Polynesia,
and America there is no tribe that is not able to secure food
by the use of natural means.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_124" id="p_124">124</a></b>. But such means are often supplemented by ceremonies that
involve some sort of supernatural influence. These ceremonies
appear to assume a social relation between man and beasts and
plants; in some cases there is assumed a recognition by animals of
the necessities of the case and a spirit of friendly co&ouml;peration; in
other cases a magical power is called into play.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_125" id="p_125">125</a></b>. Desire to propitiate the hunted animal, in order not only
to avert the anger of its kin but also to obtain its aid, appears in
the numerous cases in which excuses are made for the killing, and
the animal is implored to make a friendly report of the man to
its friends and to return in order that it may be killed.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Formal
prayer is sometimes made to the animal in important tribal ceremonies,
as in British Columbia a boy is ordered by the chief to
pray to the first salmon sighted for a good catch;<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> here the good
will of the salmon tribe and the quasi-human intelligence of the
fish are assumed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span><b><a name="p_126" id="p_126">126</a></b>. Precautions are taken to guard against antagonistic extrahuman
influences; there are taboos and rules of purification in
preparation for hunting. In New Guinea hunters are required to
abstain from certain sorts of food and to perform purificatory ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>
Among the Nandi some men are forbidden to hunt,
make traps, or dig pits for game;<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> these men, it would seem, are
supposed to be, for ceremonial reasons, antipathetic to the animals
to be hunted, as, on the other hand, there are men who attract
game.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> The taboos of food and other things imposed are doubtless
intended to guard against malefic spirits or mana. The particular
rules are determined by local conditions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_127" id="p_127">127</a></b>. Certain rules about eating the food secured by hunting
appear to have come from the desire to act in an orderly manner
and with due respect to the animal. When it is prescribed that a
bone shall not be broken this may be for fear of giving offense to
the animal kin and thus insuring failure in further hunting.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> The
provision that each man shall gather of a fruit or vegetable only so
much as will suffice for a single day may have had an economic
ground, the desire to avoid waste; or it may have been made also
partly in the interest of orderliness, and so have had originally no
reference to any superhuman being.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> Naturally it was taken up
into religion and given a religious sanction.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_128" id="p_128">128</a></b>. In Central Australia, where every clan is charged with the
duty of procuring a particular food (its totem) for the tribe, the
custom is that when the product of hunting or gathering is brought
in to be thrown into the tribal store, the principal men of the hunting
group begin by eating a little of the food, after which the food is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>licit for the rest of the tribe but illicit for the hunters.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> This custom
has been held to have a sacramental significance; it has been suggested
that the food is sanctified by the touch of the elders and thus
made lawful for the tribe, or that, as naturally sacred, it secures,
when eaten, union between the eater and a superhuman Power.
But there is no hint of such a conception in the Australian ceremony
or elsewhere. The procedure is obligatory and solemn&mdash;to omit it
would be, in the feeling of the people, to imperil the life of the
tribe; but all such usages are sanctified by time. We should rather
seek for the origin of the custom in some simple early idea. It is
not unusual, in parts of Australia and in other lands, that a man,
though he may not eat his totem, may kill it for others; the eating
in this case is the important thing&mdash;there is magical power in it&mdash;and
the economic obligation to provide food overbears the sense of
reverence for the totem. The only obscure point in the ceremony
under consideration is the obligation on the killer or gatherer to taste
the food before he gives it to his fellows. This may be a survival
of the rule, known to exist among some tribes, that in a hunting
party he who kills an animal has the first right to it. The Australian
hunter cannot eat his totem, but he may hold to his traditional right;
the result will be the custom as it now exists. With our present
knowledge no quite satisfactory explanation of the origin of this
particular rule can be given.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_129" id="p_129">129</a></b>. The employment of magical means for procuring food
appears in the performance of ceremonial dances, in the use of
charms, the imitation of animals, and other procedures. In California
the supply of acorns and animals is supposed to be increased
by dances.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> The New Guinea Koita give their hunting dogs decoctions
of sago and other food into which are put pieces of odoriferous
bark;<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> these charms are said to have been got from the Papuans,
the lowest race of the region. A Pawnee folk-story (which doubtless
reflects a current idea) tells how a boy by his songs (that is, magic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>songs or charms) brought the buffalo within reach of his people.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>
Among the Melanesians of New Guinea the hunting expert plays a
great r&ocirc;le&mdash;his presence is necessary for the success of an expedition.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
He fixes the date of the hunt, prepares himself by a series
of abstinences,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> and at the appointed time assembles the men, recites
spells addressed to ancestors, and passing along the lines of the
hunters imitates the movements of the animal sought.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_130" id="p_130">130</a></b>. Very elaborate ceremonies including imitations of animals
(imitative or sympathetic magic) are found in Central Australia.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>
When any animal is to be hunted the old men of the appropriate
totemic group, dressed to imitate the totem and accompanied by
some of the young men, repair to a spot regarded as sacred, and,
along with other ceremonies, trace on the sacred rock, with blood
drawn from the young men, a picture of the animal, or figures
representing its growth&mdash;in general, something that sets forth its
personality. These ceremonies, very numerous and extending over
a long space of time, constitute the main business of the elders, as,
in fact, the procuring of food is the chief concern of the people.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_131" id="p_131">131</a></b>. There is no perceptible religious element in these Australian
ceremonies&mdash;no utterance of charms or prayers, no mention of
any supernatural being. The acts appear to be simply procedures
of imitative magic, customs sanctified by long usage. They relate
to the life of the tribe; this life, like all life, is mysterious and therefore
sacred.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> The belief in the potency of the ceremonies appears
to come from belief in the vital identity of the two groups, human
and nonhuman&mdash;the latter is supposed to respond, in some occult
way, to the expression of kinship involved in the official proceedings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_132" id="p_132">132</a></b>. The employment of blood (considered as the locus of life)
may indicate more definitely a sense of the unity of life-force; the
human blood is, perhaps, supposed to stimulate life in the kindred
animal group, and so to produce a large supply of individuals. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>the published accounts there is no hint that the blood is supposed
to have atoning power. There is no sense of wrongdoing or unworthiness
on the part of the performers, or of any relation to a
deity. The theology of Central Australia is still obscure&mdash;the general
religious situation in that region has much that is enigmatical.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_133" id="p_133">133</a></b>. A more advanced ritual occurs among certain agricultural
tribes, among whom is found a more elaborate use of blood and a
definite recognition of superhuman beings. In these communities
it is regarded as necessary to profitable tilling to fertilize the soil
with the blood of a slain victim, sometimes human (as among the
Khonds of Orissa, the Pawnees, and others<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>), sometimes bestial (as
in Southern India<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>); parts of the victim's flesh are buried, or blood
is sprinkled on the seed, and homage is paid to a sacred stone or
some similar object.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_134" id="p_134">134</a></b>. In more civilized agricultural communities these ceremonies
persist in attenuated form. There is a sacrifice of first-born animals
to a deity and an offering of the first fruits of the field; and as children,
no less than crops, are the gift of the gods, whose bounty
must be recognized, it is not surprising to find that, along with the
first fruits of the field, first-born children are sometimes sacrificed to
the deity. Such a custom is reported as existing or having existed
in New South Wales, Florida, East Africa, heathen Russia, the Fiji
Islands, and Northern India.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> A trace of the custom among the
early Hebrews is, probably, to be recognized in the provision of the
Old Testament code that the first-born children are to be redeemed
by an animal sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_135" id="p_135">135</a></b>. In the course of time many ceremonies grew up in connection
with the procuring and housing of crops and other supplies.
In Australia the men of the clan charged with assuring any sort of
food were unarmed and fasted during their ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Among the
Kondyan plowing and sowing are solemn seasons, an auspicious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>day is chosen, and there are religious songs and choruses.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> For
the Hos of Northeastern India the harvest home is a great festival,
held with sacrifice and prayer (though also with great license
of manners).<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> A dim conception of law underlies all these procedures.
The law is sometimes natural, as in imitative processes,
sometimes religious, as when blood is employed or the agency of
religious official persons is called in.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_136" id="p_136">136</a></b>. The economical importance of rain has led to various quasi-scientific
and magical devices for securing it, and to the rise of professional
rain makers. The methods commonly employed are mimic
representations of rainfall or of a storm.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> The Australian Arunta
have a rain clan whose function is to bring the desired supply
by nonsacred dancing festivals and sacred ceremonies. A more
advanced method is to dip a stone, as rain-god, into a stream.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
Certain American tribes assign the duty of rain making to secret
societies or to priests.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_137" id="p_137">137</a></b>. All such economical ceremonies disappear with the progress
of knowledge, though traces of them linger long in civilized communities.
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen note the gradual disappearance
of the economical and magical aspect of ceremonies in parts
of Australia, and a similar process is to be observed elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Apotropaic Ceremonies</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_138" id="p_138">138</a></b>. The savage and half-civilized belief (a belief that has survived
to some extent in civilized communities) is that the ills that
afflict or threaten a community (such as epidemics and shortage of
crops) are due not to natural causes but to supernatural agencies.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>But man, it is held, may control the hostile supernatural agents&mdash;they
are subject to fear and other emotions, and though powerful are
not omnipotent; they may be expelled or otherwise got rid of&mdash;violence
may be used against them, or the aid of stronger supernatural
Powers may be called in. In pursuance of these ends
ceremonies have been devised in many parts of the world; though
differing in details they are alike in principle; the question is how
man may become the master of the demons. The ceremonies are
sometimes performed on the occasion of particular afflictions, sometimes
are massed at stated seasons, as at the beginning of the year
or in connection with some agricultural festival.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_139" id="p_139">139</a></b>. Man's defensive attitude toward the supernatural world
appears in many usages connected with ordinary life. Fear of the
hostility of ghosts has led surviving friends to take precautions
against their return&mdash;their own houses are closed to them and
they are driven away with blows.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> They are too near akin to be
trusted, and they are believed to be able and willing to do harm.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a>
At the other extreme of life, when the child comes into the world,
mother and child must be guarded against hostile demonic influences.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>
When a demon is known to have entered into a human
being, producing sickness or madness, exorcism must be resorted
to; magicians, prophets, and saints are able by ceremonies or by
prayer to expel the intruder and restore the afflicted to health.
Ritual taint (which is supernatural), incurred, for example, by touching
a dead body, is removed by sprinkling with sacred water.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_140" id="p_140">140</a></b>. But the term "apotropaic" is generally used of expulsive
ceremonies in which a whole community takes part. In the simplest
forms of procedure the hostile spirits are driven out of the
village by shouts and blows; crowds of men rush through the
streets, searching houses, expelling spirits at every possible point
of ingress, and finally forcing them outside the limits of the community.
Examples of such a custom are found in the Pacific
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>Islands, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, West Africa, Cambodia, India,
North America (Eskimo), South America (Peru),<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> and there are
survivals in modern Europe. In China this wholesale expulsion is
still practiced in a very elaborate form.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> Among the Ainu, it is said,
on the occasion of any accident the "spirit of accidents" (a useful
generalization) is driven away by the community.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> In these cases
the spirits are thought of as being in a sort corporeal, sensitive to
blows, and also as afraid of noise. There is sometimes a combination
of natural and supernatural conceptions: while the violent
expulsive process is going on the household utensils are vigorously
washed by the women; washing, known to cleanse from mere
physical dirt, here also takes on, from its association with the men's
ceremony of expulsion, a supernatural potency&mdash;it removes the
injurious mana of the hostile spirits.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_141" id="p_141">141</a></b>. Less violent methods of riddance may be employed. Evil,
being a physical thing, may be embodied in some object, nonhuman
or human, which is then carried forth or sent away to some distant
point, or destroyed. With this principle of transference may be
compared the conception of solidarity of persons and things in a
tribe or other community: what one unit does or suffers affects all&mdash;the
presence of an accursed thing with one person brings a curse
on his nation,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> and conversely, the removal of the evil thing or person
removes the curse, which may, under certain circumstances,
be shifted to some other place or person.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_142" id="p_142">142</a></b>. The particular method of expulsion or transference is immaterial.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>
The troublesome evil may be carted or boated away
according to local convenience, or it may depart in the person of
an animal. Leprous taint is transferred to a bird, which, having
been dipped in the blood of a sacred animal, is allowed to fly away
carrying the taint off from the community.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> Even moral evils (sin)
may thus be got rid of. In the great Hebrew annual ceremony
of atonement not only the ritual impurity of the sanctuary and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>the altar, but also the sin of the nation, is laid on a goat and sent
away to the wilderness demon, Azazel.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_143" id="p_143">143</a></b>. Examples of human apotropaic vehicles occur in the ancient
civilized world. In the Athenian Thargelia the Pharmakos was
supposed to bear in his person crimes and evils, and was driven
forth from the city.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> The same conception is found, perhaps, in the
Roman Mamuralia and Lupercalia. In the first of these Mamertius
is driven forth from the city and consigned to the keeping of
hostile persons;<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> in the second, young men ran about the streets
beating the women with strips of goatskin, the skin being that of a
sacred animal&mdash;a proceeding that was regarded as purificatory,
and seems to be naturally explicable as an expulsion of evil spirits
or injurious mana.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_144" id="p_144">144</a></b>. In another direction expulsion of evil, or protection against
it, is effected by the blood of a sacrificed (and therefore sacred)
animal. A well-known example of this sort of ceremony is the
Hebrew <i>pesah</i> (the old lamb ceremony, later combined with the
agricultural festival of unleavened bread, at the time of the first
harvest, the two together then constituting the passover); here
the doorposts and lintel of every house were sprinkled with the
blood of a slain lamb by the master of the house,<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> and the hostile
spirits hovering in the air were thus prevented from entering. The
sacred blood seems to have been conceived of as carrying with it
the power of the family god (who was also the clan god), which
overbore that of the demons (in the earliest period, however, the
efficacy was doubtless held to reside simply in the blood itself).
The ceremony belonged to each family, but it belonged also to the
clan since it was performed by every family, and ultimately it became
a national usage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span><b><a name="p_145" id="p_145">145</a></b>. Apotropaic ceremonies appear to have been performed
originally at various times during the year as occasions arose;
the increasing pressure of occupations,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> the necessity of consulting
people's convenience, and the demand for order and precision led
here (as in other cases) to the massing of the observances. When
so massed they begin to lose their original significance, to yield to
the knowledge of natural law, to be reinterpreted from time to time,
and finally to become mere social events or to be dropped altogether.
Apotropaism has hardly survived at all in the higher religions.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> In
popular customs it appears in the reliance placed on horseshoes
and other objects as means of keeping witches and similar demonic
things out of houses.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Ceremonies of Puberty and Initiation</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_146" id="p_146">146</a></b>. Ceremonies in connection with the arrival of young persons,
male and female, at the age of maturity appear to be universal, and
they yield in importance to no other class of social procedures.
The basis of most of these is civil; their object is to prepare young
persons for entering on the active duties of what may be called
citizenship. They involve a distinct idea of the importance of the
clan, the necessity of maintaining its life unimpaired, and, to that
end, preparing with the utmost care the younger portion of the
community to take up the duties of the older. The boys are to
be trained to be the hunters and rulers of the clan, the girls are to
be fitted to become the wives and mothers of the next generation.
But while the ceremonies in question have their foundation in the
needs of civil life, they inevitably receive a religious coloring, since
religion is intimately connected with all the details of early life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_147" id="p_147">147</a></b>. Among the details of the initiation of boys, tests of endurance
occupy a prominent place. In various ways the capacity
of the lad to endure physical pain or to face apparent dangers is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>tested,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> and in some cases one who fails to stand such tests is refused
admission into the clan and forever after occupies an inferior
and despised position. Such persons are sometimes treated
as women; they are required to wear women's dress and to do
menial work.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_148" id="p_148">148</a></b>. The seclusion of girls on arriving at the age of puberty, with
imposition of various taboos (of food, etc.), is a widespread custom.
The mysterious change in the girl is supposed to be produced
by some supernatural and dangerous Power, and she is therefore to
be shielded from contact with all injurious things. The details of
the procedure depend on local ideas, but the principle is the same
everywhere. The object is the preparation of the girl for civic life,
and the ceremony inevitably becomes connected with tribal cults of
the supernatural Powers.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_149" id="p_149">149</a></b>. A rearrangement of taboos is a frequent feature in ceremonies
of puberty and initiation. Certain taboos, no longer needed,
are removed and others are imposed; these latter refer, in the case
of boys, to intercourse with the men and women of the clan or
tribe&mdash;they are instructed not to speak to certain persons, and
in general they are made acquainted with the somewhat elaborate
social system that prevails in many early tribes. These taboos are
intended to prepare the boys to understand their position as members
of the tribe, responsible for the maintenance of its customs. The
taboos relating to food have arisen from conditions whose origins
belong to a remote and unrecorded past, and remain obscure.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_150" id="p_150">150</a></b>. When the ceremony of initiation is elaborate and secret,
it becomes mysterious to boys, is looked forward to by them with
apprehension, and appeals to their imagination. Supernatural terrors
are provided by the leaders&mdash;noises are heard (made by the bull-roarer
or some similar device), and the report is circulated that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>initiate is in danger of death at the hands of a supernatural being.
These methods testify to the importance attached by early societies
to the introduction of the young into social and political life, and
they furnish an early example of the employment of the supernatural
for the government of the masses. The old men do not
believe in their supernatural machinery, and the boys, after initiation,
are let into the secret.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_151" id="p_151">151</a></b>. <i>Mutilation</i> of the body is a widespread custom in connection
with initiation and arrival at the age of puberty.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> In most cases the
origin of mutilating customs is obscure. Imitation of the form or
appearance of a sacred animal, embellishment of the initiate, or
consecration of a part of the body to a deity have been suggested
as motives; but there is no clear evidence of such designs. The
knocking out of a tooth may be for convenience in taking food;
it seems not to have religious significance except in so far as all
tribal marks become religiously important.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> Boring through the
septum of the nose is perhaps for decorative purposes. The cutting
of the hair is possibly for convenience, possibly for dedication
to a deity.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_152" id="p_152">152</a></b>. Among the most important of the customs of initiation
are those connected with the organs of generation, excluding, as is
remarked above, complete excision, which belongs to conceptions
of religious asceticism (consecration to a deity, preservation against
temptation) in the higher cults, and is not found among savages.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>
Partial excision occurs in circumcision, for males, and in similar
operations for females.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_153" id="p_153">153</a></b>. <i>Circumcision of males.</i><a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> The most widely diffused of such
customs of initiation is the gashing or the complete removal of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>prepuce. It existed in ancient times among the Egyptians, the
Canaanites, and the Hebrews (for the Arabs, the Syrians, and the
Babylonians and Assyrians we have no information), not, so far as
the records go, among the Greeks, Romans, and Hindus. At the
present time it is found among all Moslems and most Jewish communities,
throughout Africa, Australia, Polynesia and Melanesia,
and, it is said, in Eastern Mexico. It is hardly possible to say what
its original distribution was, and whether or not there was a single
center of distribution. As to its origin many theories have been
advanced. Its character as initiatory is not an explanation&mdash;all
customs of initiation need to have their origins explained. It may
be said at the outset that a usage prevalent in low tribes and clearly
beginning under savage conditions of life must, probably, have
sprung from some simple physical need, not from advanced scientific
or religious conceptions. We may briefly examine the principal
explanations of its origin that have been offered.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_154" id="p_154">154</a></b>. It cannot be regarded as a test of endurance, for it involves
no great suffering, and neither it nor the severer operation of subincision<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
(practiced in Australia) is ever spoken of as an official test.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_155" id="p_155">155</a></b>. A hygienic ground is out of the question for early society.
The requisite medical observation is then lacking, and there is
no hint of such a motive in the material bearing on the subject.
Circumcision is employed in modern surgery for certain diseases
and as a generally helpful operation, but such employment appears
to be modern and of limited extent. The exact meaning of Herodotus's
statement that the Egyptians were circumcised for the sake
of cleanliness, preferring it to beauty,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> is not clear; but in any case
so late an idea throws no light on the beginnings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_156" id="p_156">156</a></b>. Somewhat more to the point is Crawley's view that the
object of the removal of the prepuce is to get rid of the dangerous
emanation from the physical secretion therewith connected.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> Such
an object would issue from savage ideas of magic, the secretions
of the human body (as urine and dung) being often supposed to
contain the power resident in all life. But this view, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>conceivably correct, is without support from known facts. There is
no trace of fear of the secretion in question, and the belief in power,
when such a belief appears, attaches rather to the oblated prepuce
(which is sometimes preserved as a sort of charm, or hidden, or
swallowed by the boy or by some other person) than to the secretion.
Nor does this theory account for the custom of subincision.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_157" id="p_157">157</a></b>. As circumcision is often performed shortly before marriage
it has been suggested that its object is to increase procreative
power by preventing phimosis.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> The opinion that such is its effect,
though it has no scientific support, has been and is held by not a
few persons. Such an object, however, is improbable for low stages
of society&mdash;it implies an extent of observation that is not to be
assumed for savages; and there is, besides, the fact that certain
tribes (in Australia and elsewhere) that practice circumcision do not
connect the birth of children with sexual intercourse. In general it
is not to be supposed that savages make well-considered physical
preparation for marriage in the interests of procreation. The choice
of mates is determined by tribal law, but in other respects the individual
is generally left free before marriage to satisfy his appetite&mdash;it
is instinct that controls the relations between the sexes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_158" id="p_158">158</a></b>. There is no clear evidence that the origin of circumcision
is to be traced to religious conceptions. It has been held that it is
connected with the cult of the generative organs (phallic worship).<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>
It is true that a certain sacredness often attached to these organs;
this appears, for example, in the oath taken by laying the hands upon
or under the thigh, as in the story of Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> In some parts of
Africa circumcision is directly connected or combined with the worship
of the phallus.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> But, on the other hand, each of these customs is
found frequently without the other: in India we have phallic worship
without circumcision, in Australia circumcision without phallic worship;
and this separateness of the two may be said to be the rule.
The cult of the phallus seems not to exist among the lowest peoples.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_159" id="p_159">159</a></b>. The view that circumcision is of the nature of a sacrifice
or dedication to a deity, particularly to a deity of fertility, appears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>to be derived from late usages in times when more refined ideas
have been attached to early customs. The Phrygian practice of
excision was regarded, probably, as a sacrifice. But elsewhere, in
Egypt, Babylonia, Syria, and Canaan, where the worship of gods
and goddesses of fertility was prominent, we do not find circumcision
connected therewith. In the writings of the Old Testament
prophets it is treated as a symbol of moral purification. Among
the lower peoples there is no trace of the conception of it as a
sacrifice. It is not circumcision that makes the phallus sacred&mdash;it
is sacred in itself, and all procedures of savage veneration for
the prepuce assume its inherent potency.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_160" id="p_160">160</a></b>. Nor can circumcision be explained as an attenuated survival
of human sacrifice. The practice (in Peru and elsewhere) of
drawing blood from the heads or hands of children on solemn
occasions may be a softening of an old savage custom, and the
blood of circumcision is sacred. But this quality attaches to all
blood, and the essential thing in circumcision is not the blood but
the removal of the prepuce.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_161" id="p_161">161</a></b>. The suggestion that the object of detaching and preserving
the foreskin (a vital part of one's self) is to lay up a stock of vital
energy, and thus secure reincarnation for the disembodied spirit,<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a>
is putting an afterthought for origin. The existence of the practice
in question is doubtful, and it must have arisen, if it existed, after
circumcision had become an established custom. Savages and other
peoples, when they feel the need of providing for reincarnation,
commonly preserve the bones or the whole body of the deceased.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_162" id="p_162">162</a></b>. <i>Circumcision and other operations performed on females.</i>
Circumcision of girls is practiced by many African savage tribes
(Nandi, Masai, Mandingos, and others), by Malays and Arabs,
Gallas and Abessinians and others. Introcision appears to be confined
to Australia. Infibulation is practiced in Northeastern Africa
and by the Mohammedan Malays.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> The effect, and doubtless the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>purpose, of the first and second of these operations is to facilitate
coition; the object of the third is to prevent coition until the proper
time for it arrives. They are all connected more or less with initiation
or with arrival at the age of puberty, and they are, naturally,
sometimes associated with other ceremonies.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_163" id="p_163">163</a></b>. <i>Origin of circumcision.</i> The preceding review may be taken
to make it probable that the origin of circumcision is not to be
referred to reflection or to religious ideas. We must look for a
cruder motive, and several considerations point to the desire to
facilitate coition as the starting-point of the custom (so also R. F.
Burton). Reports from all over the savage world testify to the
prominence of sexual intercourse in the lower forms of human
life. Folk-stories are full of coarse details of the practice. Popular
festivals are often characterized by gross license. To lend a wife
to a guest is in many places a recognized rule of hospitality.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> In
all this there is nothing immoral&mdash;it is permitted by the existing
law and is in accord with the current ideas of propriety. Early
man seems in this regard to have obeyed his animal appetite without
reflection. This form of pleasure occupied (and occupies) a
great part of his life, and it was not unnatural that he should seek
to remove all hindrances from it. It is quite conceivable that early
observation led him to regard the prepuce as a hindrance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_164" id="p_164">164</a></b>. About the motives of early man in the adoption of these
customs of excision we have, of course, no direct information;
but some later usages favor the explanation suggested above.
The operations performed on females are obviously dictated by
considerations of convenience or propriety in coition. Various
means are adopted of increasing the pleasure of sexual intercourse
(in Indonesia and elsewhere).<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> These procedures are purely animal,
nonmoral, and without ulterior design; there is no thought of
progeny or, in general, of preparation for marriage&mdash;the frame of
mind is appropriate to the lowest grade of life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span><b><a name="p_165" id="p_165">165</a></b>. In the course of time, however, all such customs tend to
become sanctified and to take on new meanings. When the importance
of circumcision was generally felt, it was natural that
it should be performed at puberty and at initiation.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> It would
thus come to be regarded as an introduction to the tribal life&mdash;not
as preparation, but as a custom established by unwritten law.
Its origination would be put far back in the past and sometimes
ascribed to supernatural personages&mdash;the Central Australians
refer it to the mythical ancestors, the later Jews to the command
of the national deity issued to the legendary or mythical ancestor
Abram.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Under certain circumstances it might become a tribal
mark; the Hebrews thus distinguished themselves from their
neighbors the Philistines, and "uncircumcised" was a term of
reproach.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_166" id="p_166">166</a></b>. Apart from its use in initiation the cultic r&ocirc;le of circumcision
has been small. It does not appear as an element in the
worship of any deity, neither in that of such gods as Osiris, Tammuz,
Adonis, Attis, nor in that of any other. It is not represented
in ancient records as a devotion of one's self or an assimilation
of one's self or of a child to the tribal or national god. Its performance
is generally a religious duty, as is true of every established
custom, but this fact throws no light on its origin. The
prepuce is sometimes treated as an amulet or in general as a magically
powerful or sacred thing; but many other parts of the body
(hair, finger nails, etc.) are so treated.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_167" id="p_167">167</a></b>. In the higher religions circumcision is generally viewed as
an act of physical purification or as a symbol of moral purification.
The former view, perhaps, prevailed in Egypt, though on this
point the records appear to be silent.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> The latter view is that of
the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> It has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>now ceased to have any effective religious significance, and is retained
in some communities merely as a national social tradition
or as an ancient divine ordinance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_168" id="p_168">168</a></b>. The origin of circumcision suggested above seems to account
sufficiently for all usages and ideas connected with it; the
possibility of several different origins need not be denied, but
the practical identity of the customs in all parts of the world in
which the institution exists, makes the simpler hypothesis the
more probable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_169" id="p_169">169</a></b>. Certain features of ceremonies of initiation appear to be
designed to secure <i>union</i> between the initiate and the clan. Such,
for example, is the custom found in New South Wales of the
initiate's drinking the blood of his companions. In other cases there
is a union with other parts of the body. Such usages arise from the
idea that physical union is essential to social union&mdash;a conception
which elsewhere takes the form of blood-brotherhood.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> This is a
scientific rather than a religious idea, depending on the belief that
the body is an essential part of the personality.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_170" id="p_170">170</a></b>. Another noteworthy custom is the feigned <i>resurrection</i> of the
initiate. In Australia the women are informed that the youth during
the process of initiation is slain by a supernatural being and brought
to life again. Elsewhere the initiate is supposed to forget his former
life completely and to be obliged, on emerging from the ceremony,
to recover slowly his knowledge of things.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> The origin of this custom
is obscure, but it appears to express the idea that the youth now
enters on an entirely new life, and having come into new relations
and responsibilities, is to forget what he was and what he did
before&mdash;a profound conception which has been taken up into some
of the most advanced religions (as, for example, in baptism and
confirmation).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_171" id="p_171">171</a></b>. In certain half-civilized tribes a higher type of initiatory
ceremonies is found. The youth must perform a lonely vigil, going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>into the forest or some other solitary place, and there wait for the
vision or revelation of a supernatural protector.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> This procedure
is connected with the advance of individualism, the old totemic or
other relation being superseded by an individual relation to a
guardian spirit. The development of this higher religious conception
will be discussed below.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_172" id="p_172">172</a></b>. Finally, instruction forms a part of most initiation ceremonies.
The youth is told the secrets of the tribe, and is thus
inducted into its higher and more intimate life.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> This confiding of
tribal secrets (the tradition and the knowledge of sacred things) to
the young man about to enter on public life is a political necessity,
but in the nature of the case connects itself with religious conceptions.
Generally, also, moral instruction is given.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> The ethical code
is usually good so far as intratribal relations are concerned (foreigners
are not considered): the youth is told that he must obey his elders,
respect the rights of his fellow clansmen, and especially be careful
in his attitude toward women. In some cases a supernatural sanction
for such instructions is added; it is impressed on the youth that
some supernatural being will punish him if he disobeys these instructions.
The moral code in question is one which springs naturally
and necessarily from the relations of men in society, and the supernatural
sanction affixed to it is a consequence of the belief that the
tribal deity is the lord of the tribe and the natural and most effective
guardian of its rights.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_173" id="p_173">173</a></b>. From this brief statement of initiation ceremonies it appears
that they rest substantially on social ideas and necessities. Religion
enters into them, as is pointed out above, when a superhuman being
is represented as the patron of the clan and the protector of its
ceremonies, or when the moral teaching is referred to such a being,
or when the initiate seeks a supernatural patron with whom to enter
into relations, or when, as in some North Australian tribes, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>supernatural being is believed to be angry at the omission of the
ceremonies. This last case might recall the displeasure of the Greek
gods when sacrifices to them were withheld or diminished; but more
probably it involves simply the belief that all important ceremonies
and affairs are under the control of the being in question, who demands
obedience to him as lord.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_174" id="p_174">174</a></b>. In later stages of savage or semicivilized life the clan constitution
as a rule has been succeeded by the formation of secret
societies, and then initiation into a society takes the place of the old
initiation into the clan.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> Initiation into such a society is often elaborate
and solemn&mdash;it is carried out in great detail in many Polynesian,
African, and North American tribes&mdash;but its general features are
the same as those of the earlier procedure. Savage societies and
civilized mysteries all have their secrets and their moral instruction,
and they all represent an advance in individualism. Still later the
church takes the place of the mysteries, and here the process of
initiation, though more refined, is still in essence identical with the
earlier forms.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Naturally in the increasing refinement of the ceremonies
there is an increasing prominence of the supernatural element,
for the reason that the special care of religion recedes more
and more from general society (which tends to occupy itself with
civil and political questions solely), and is intrusted to special
voluntary organizations.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Marriage Ceremonies</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_175" id="p_175">175</a></b>. Marriage is so important a fact for the communal life that
it has always been regulated to a greater or less extent by the
community, which defines its methods, rights, and obligations.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span><b><a name="p_176" id="p_176">176</a></b>. In the lowest known tribes the ceremony of marriage is
simple: the woman is given to the man by the constituted authorities&mdash;that
is, the relatives of the parties and the elders of the
clan or tribe&mdash;and by that act the two become husband and wife.
At this stage of social growth the stress is laid on preparation for
marriage in the ceremonies of puberty and initiation. The members
of the tribe being thus prepared for union, marriage is merely the
assignment of a given woman to a given man. The wife is selected
according to established custom; that is, in accordance with customary
law, which in most cases defines precisely from what group of
the tribe the woman proper to a given man shall be taken.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_177" id="p_177">177</a></b>. Though the origin of this law goes back to a remote antiquity
and is involved in obscurity, it seems to have been originally
simply a matter of social agreement. It came to be, however,
connected with systems of totemism and taboo, and thus to have
acquired a certain religious character; and, as being important for
the tribal life, it would come under the control of the tribal god when
there is such a god. A similar remark may be made in regard
to exogamy. Why marriage between members of the same tribe,
clan, or phratry should be prohibited is not clear.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> The rule arose,
doubtless, from some social feature of ancient society, and only
later was involved in the general religious atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_178" id="p_178">178</a></b>. Gradually greater freedom of choice was allowed men and
women, and the ceremonies of marriage became more elaborate.
Certain of these seem intended to secure the complete union of
husband and wife; such, for example, are the customs of eating
together, of the inoculation of each party with the blood of the
other or with some bodily part of the other, and the giving of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>presents by each to the other. All these rest on the conception
that union between two persons is effected by each taking something
that belongs to the other; each thus acquires something of
the other's personality. This is a scientific biological idea; and
though it had its origin doubtless in some very crude notion of life, it
has maintained itself in one form or another up to the present time.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_179" id="p_179">179</a></b>. Among many communities the custom is for the bride
to hide herself and to be pursued and taken by the bridegroom.
This custom, again, is in its origin obscure. Almost certainly it does
not point to original marriage by capture, for of such a customary
method of acquiring wives there is no trace in savage communities
(though in particular cases women may have been captured and
married). Possibly it reflects merely the coyness of the woman;
or it may be simply a festive procedure, an occasion of fun for the
young people, as indeed a wedding now commonly is. In many
cases, however, it appears to represent the transference of the woman
from her own tribe to that of her husband. Though she was thus
transferred bodily and brought into civic relations with the latter,
certain taboos, arising from her original tribal position, often clung
to her. The right to dwell in her own house in her own tribe, and
to receive there her foreign husband, belongs to a relatively late
social stage.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_180" id="p_180">180</a></b>. The defloration of the woman before marriage is rather a
preparation for marriage than a marriage ceremony; or it may represent
the social right of the elders of the tribe and the relatives
of the bride to the possession of her, perhaps symbolizing her entrance
into a family.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> The hypothesis that such a custom points to
primitive promiscuity is ably combated by Westermarck, and is involved
in great difficulties; it is, however, maintained by Messrs.
Spencer and Gillen in their two works on Australian tribes, whose
customs seem to them to be inexplicable except on the supposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>of primitive promiscuity, in spite of Westermarck's arguments; and
in support of this view the sexual license granted in many tribes
to unmarried girls may be adduced. However this may be, the
custom in question appears to be civil and not religious. The same
thing is true of the ceremonies in which bridegroom and bride are
hailed as king and queen&mdash;a very natural form of merrymaking.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
The purchase of wives is probably a simple commercial act.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_181" id="p_181">181</a></b>. The marriage ceremonies mentioned above appear to be all
social in their nature. Into them the supernatural is introduced in
proportion as the conception of a divine control of society obtains.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>
On the other hand, those customs which are intended to ward off
evil spirits or general evil influences from the married pair are
religious or magical.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_182" id="p_182">182</a></b>. Mr. Crawley<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> holds that all marriage ceremonies are essentially
religious, as involving the conception of something strange
and dangerous in the contact of men and women; they are intended,
he thinks, to neutralize dangers by reversing taboos and by
assimilating the two persons each to the other, the dangers in question
being not merely distinctly sexual but those of contact in general.
Though he carries his application of the principle of taboo
too far, he has collected a large number of examples which illustrate
the separation between the sexes in early society, and the
taboos which hold in their social intercourse. The separation of
the sexes in early times seems to have resulted largely from the
difference in their occupations and the consequent isolation of each
from the other. Possibly one result of this isolation was that each
saw something strange and wonderful in the other; but it must be
remembered that the taboo laws were made by men and are therefore
directed particularly against women. The belief in the sacredness
of life would act more particularly on the ideas concerning birth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span><b><a name="p_183" id="p_183">183</a></b>. Among many half-civilized peoples and generally in Christian
communities marriage is regarded both as a religious ceremony
and as a civil contract, and is controlled in the one case by the religious
authorities, in the other case by the civil authorities. In
Mohammedan communities marriage is simply a civil contract, but
religious ceremonies are often connected with it.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Ceremonies at Birth</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_184" id="p_184">184</a></b>. It is possible that early man was so impressed by the fact
of life and the wonderfulness of the birth of a human being that he
included this latter fact in the sphere of the supernatural, and that
the taboos connected with it arose from his dread of supernatural,
dangerous influence.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> Many of the ceremonies connected with the
birth of a child may be explained easily as resulting from the natural
care for mother and child. Both of these are, in the modern
sense of the term, sacred; and even in very early times ordinary
humane feeling would seek to protect them from injury.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_185" id="p_185">185</a></b>. Thus the curious custom of the couvade,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> in which the husband,
and not the wife, goes to bed on the birth of the child, may
be an effort on the man's part to share in the labor of the occasion,
since he has to take care of the child; or it may be primarily an
economical procedure&mdash;the woman must go out to work and the
man must therefore stay at home to take care of the house and
the child. But probably something more than this is involved&mdash;there
seems to be fear of supernatural danger. It is not necessary
to suppose that the man takes the woman's place in order to attract
to himself the malevolent spirits that figure on such occasions; but
the belief in the intimate vital connection between father and child
may induce the desire to guard the former against injury. Similar
precautions are taken in regard to the mother;<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> some of these have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>a natural basis in her physical condition which necessitates a certain
carefulness. Where such customs connected with birth prevail, departure
from them is thought to be dangerous or fatal; but such
a feeling exists in regard to all social customs.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_186" id="p_186">186</a></b>. The belief that the newborn child is the reincarnation of
an ancestor is scientific rather than religious. In Central Australia
every child is held to be the reincarnation of a spirit ancestor; a
similar idea is found in North America, in Western Africa, and in
Orissa.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> In searching for the cause of birth it is not unnatural that
it should be ascribed to a pre&euml;xistent being who desires to enter
again into human life.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_187" id="p_187">187</a></b>. The ablutions or sprinklings of water practiced in some
places appear to be merely the expression of welcome into the
community.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> The choice of a name for the child is frequently
connected with religious ideas. Among many tribes the custom
is to seek for some hint from the child itself, as by repeating a
number of names and observing which of them the child seems
to recognize or accept. The help of a deity is sometimes invoked,
as in Borneo, where a pig is killed and its spirit thus sent as messenger
to a particular god, who is asked to approve.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> In Samoa a
tutelary spirit is sometimes chosen for the infant;<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> during childhood
the child bears the name of a god, who seems to be regarded
as its protector. The identification of person and name, common
among savages, is also scientific rather than religious. At the
entrance into a secret society the novitiate may receive a new
name.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> The adoption of a child's name by the father (teknonymy)
may be simply the expression of paternal pride, or possibly it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>the expression of the father's protection or of his identification with
the child. The adoption of a secret name that involves the man's
personality and is therefore to be withheld from enemies belongs
to adult life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_188" id="p_188">188</a></b>. The taboos imposed on the mother during pregnancy and
after the birth of the child, often numerous and oppressive, are
derived from local conditions, and are generally regulated by religion.
With the growth of refinement they tend to disappear, while
the attendant ceremonies take on a moral and spiritual character,
culminating, in the great religions, in the conception that the babe,
as a child of God, is to be taken into the religious fellowship of the
community and trained for a good life.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Burial Ceremonies</span><a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_189" id="p_189">189</a></b>. Among savage peoples grief for the dead expresses itself
in a variety of violent ceremonies of mourning, such as wailing, and
cutting and gashing the body. These are partly expressions of natural
sorrow,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> but may be intended in part to propitiate the dead,
who thus sees that honor is paid him.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_190" id="p_190">190</a></b>. The belief that the dead person is powerful expresses itself
in the care with which the grave is guarded, it being held that
injury to the grave is an injury to the dead, and likely, therefore,
to excite his anger. Further, savage science as a rule does not
recognize natural causes of death. It regards death as murder,
and there is accordingly search for the murderer, often by protracted
ceremonies with the aid of a magician. The well-being of
the dead man is provided for by placing food and drink, utensils
and weapons in his grave, that he may have the means of enjoyment
in the other world.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> To assure him proper service his wives

to a relatively advanced conception of the other life.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> In many

as in Borneo (the blood of a fowl);<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> the blood may be meant to
be food for the dead, or its supernatural power may be supposed
to guard against injury from him to the living.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_191" id="p_191">191</a></b>. A ban of silence is often imposed&mdash;the name of the dead
person is not to be mentioned except by certain privileged men;<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>
among certain North American tribes on the death of a child there
is a ban of silence on the father.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> The reason for this prohibition
of the dead person's name is not certain. It may be respect for
him, or it may be merely an expression of sorrow at his loss. More
probably, however, it comes from the belief that the dead man is
powerful and may be hurtful, and that therefore his name, which
is identical with himself, is dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_192" id="p_192">192</a></b>. In the cases mentioned above, the dead person is generally
regarded as dangerous&mdash;to be feared and appeased. Among some
tribes, indeed, precautions are taken to prevent his coming back to
his house. Very generally the presence of the corpse is held to
cause a certain pollution.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> There is, however, another side to the
attitude toward the dead. As he is regarded as powerful, parts of
his body are preserved as amulets; wives wear parts of the bones
of the dead husband, and the skulls of the deceased are supposed
to be especially powerful, in some cases to give oracular responses.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_193" id="p_193">193</a></b>. In general, early burial ceremonies appear to be designed
to assure the comfort of the deceased in the other world with a
view to securing his friendship and aid for the members of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>family and clan in this life. As he is of the nature of a divine
person, the ceremonies in question are naturally religious. Socially
they are effective in binding the members of a community together&mdash;a
large sense of solidarity is produced by the communal recognition
of kinship with the dead. Special stress is laid on this conception
in China.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Ceremonies of Purification and Consecration</span><a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_194" id="p_194">194</a></b>. The essence of religion is a helpful relation to the supernatural,
but in early stages of culture man frequently finds himself
exposed to conditions, either resident in himself or induced from
without, that destroy this relation and disqualify him for the performance
of sacred acts. The result is a state of ritual impurity
or uncleanness, conceived of at first as purely physical, but tending
to become gradually moralized. The removal of the disqualification
constitutes purification; the positive preparation for the performance
of a sacred act constitutes consecration; the two procedures
represent two sides of the same idea, and they are related in a
general way to ceremonies of initiation and atonement.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_195" id="p_195">195</a></b>. The occasions for purification are numerous, including all
contacts or possibilities of contact with dangerous (sacred) things,
and thus often coinciding with taboo conceptions.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> All acts connected
with procreation and birth; contact with a corpse, or with
a sacred person or thing, or with an object belonging to a sacred
person; return from a journey (in the course of which the traveler
may have been exposed to some injurious supernatural influence)<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>&mdash;such
things as these call for cleansing. Inanimate objects also,
especially such as are connected with religious worship (altars,
vessels, and instruments), require purification; these are thought
of originally as having souls, and as incurring defilement by the
transmission of neighboring impurities. A moral conception may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>seem to be involved in the requirement of purification after the
committal of a murder; certainly, in the more advanced stages of
society, the feeling in this case is moral, but it is doubtful whether
in earlier stages anything more is involved than the recognition of
ritual defilement by contact with blood; homicide, as a social crime,
is dealt with by the civil law, and is generally excluded from the
benefits of acts of ritual atonement,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> and so also all violations of
tribal law.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_196" id="p_196">196</a></b>. The religious preparation for the performance of a sacred
act usually concerns official persons (see below, under <i>consecration</i>,
&sect; 202), but sometimes involves the purification of others. The
largest act of purification is that which includes a whole community
or people;<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> the social mass is then regarded as a unit, and there is
no reason, according to early thought, why such a mass should not,
by a ceremony, be freed from all ritual disabilities, the idea of moral
purification being, of course, absent or latent. Finally, ritual purification
is sometimes a preliminary to pleasing and influencing the
deity, who, as the most sacred and most dangerous object, must
be approached with the greatest precautions.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_197" id="p_197">197</a></b>. The various methods of purification may be included under
a few heads, the principal of which are: the application of water
(bathing, sprinkling); the application of sand, dung, bark, and
similar things; exposure to fire; incantation and sacrifice; and
fasting. In all these cases the virtue lies either in a sacred thing
or act that has the quality of dissipating the mysterious defilement
present, or in the removal or avoidance of the defiling thing; it is
frequently required that the application of the cleansing substance
be made by a sacred person, whose character adds potency to the
act. The use of water for ceremonial purification has been, and
is, practiced all over the world, alike by savages and by civilized
peoples:<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> the newborn child, ritually impure by reason of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>mystery of birth, is bathed or sprinkled; before the performance
of a sacred act the officiator must bathe;<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> numerous ablutions are
prescribed in the Old Testament; similar usages obtained among
the Egyptians, the Hindus and the Persians, the Greeks and the
Romans, the Chinese and the Japanese, the Mexicans and the
Peruvians, and other peoples.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_198" id="p_198">198</a></b>. These usages have arisen doubtless from observation of
the natural cleansing power of water and other things in conjunction
with the belief in their sacred character. Adopted by the
higher religions they have been more or less spiritualized by the
infusion into them of ideas of penitence, forgiveness of sin, and
regeneration&mdash;so in India, Persia, and Peru. Christian baptism
seems to have come from Jewish proselyte baptism:<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> the proselyte
was by immersion in water symbolically cleansed from sin and introduced
into a new religious life, and such was the significance of
the rite practiced by John, though his surname "the Baptizer"
probably indicates that he gave it a broader and deeper meaning;
he overstepped national bounds, receiving Jews as well as non-Jews.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
Moslem ritual requires ablutions before the stated prayers
and at certain other times; every mosque has its tank of water
for the convenience of worshipers.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_199" id="p_199">199</a></b>. Where water cannot be had, usage in Islam and in some
forms of Christianity permits the substitution of sand or dust&mdash;both
thought to have cleansing power. Similar power is ascribed
to urine and dung of domestic animals.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> Such usages may originate
in a belief in the physical cleansing efficacy of those substances
(the Toda women employ dried buffalo's dung in household cleaning),
or they may be supposed to derive their efficacy from the
sacredness of the animals. The Todas also make much use of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>certain bark for purification.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> The origin of these customs is
obscure; they go back to times and conditions for a knowledge
of which data are lacking&mdash;possibly to the early conception of the
sacredness of all natural objects.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> It is less difficult to explain the
belief in the purifying power of fire. Its splendor and utility caused
it to be regarded as a god in India and Persia, and if it was also
destructive, it often consumed hurtful things. It was sacred, and
might, therefore, be a remover of impurity. Its employment for
this purpose is, however, not frequent;<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> it is oftener used to consume
corpses and other unclean things.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_200" id="p_200">200</a></b>. In the more developed religious rituals, sacrifice is a common
accompaniment of purifying ceremonies, the object being to
procure the forgiveness of the deity for the offense held to be involved
in the impurity; the conception of sin in such cases is
sometimes physical, sometimes moral, and the ceremony is always
nearly allied to one of atonement. In the Hebrew ritual a human
bodily impurity and the apparatus of the temple alike require a
sin-offering.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> In India the bath of purification stood in close relation
with a sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> In Greece the two were associated in the
cults of Apollo and Dionysos and in ordinary worship in general.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>
Thus, men and gods take part in the process of freeing the
worshiper from the impure elements of life: the man obeys the
law of the ritual, and the god receives him into association with
the divine.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_201" id="p_201">201</a></b>. Ancient examples of the purification of a whole community
are the Hebrew ceremony on the annual day of atonement<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> (which
is called in the text a purification), and the Roman Lupercalia.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>An elaborate festival of this sort was observed every year by the
Creeks;<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> it lasted eight days, included various cathartic observances,
and ended in a physical and moral reconstruction of the
nation. Among the Todas a similar ceremony for the purification
of a village exists.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_202" id="p_202">202</a></b>. Ceremonies of <i>consecration</i> are similar to those of purification,
only usually more formal and solemn. Entrance on a sacred
function, which involves special direct contact with a deity, requires
special preparation. Even before a simple act of prayer it was felt
to be proper to cleanse one's person;<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> how much more important
was bodily cleansing and other preparation for one who was
chosen by the community to represent it in its relations with the
supernatural Powers! The preparation for such an office is in
earlier times ritual and external, and becomes gradually moralized.
Magicians must submit to purificatory restrictions, and
prove their fitness by various deeds.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> Initiation into secret societies
(whose members had a certain official character) was, and
is, often elaborate.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Priests in Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria,
Canaan, India, Greece and Rome, were subject to conditions of
purity, always physical and sometimes moral, that secured a daily
consecration.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_203" id="p_203">203</a></b>. Methods of initial consecration were, probably, of the
general character of those prescribed in the Hebrew ritual law.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>
Authority is often conferred by a high official, whose consecrating
act is then generally regarded as essential.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> The priest becomes
invested with a quasi-divine authority. The consecration of kings
follows the same general lines as that of priests. In both cases the
desire is to have some visible form of the deity whose relations
with men may be felt to be direct.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span><b><a name="p_204" id="p_204">204</a></b>. No purificatory and consecrative usage has been more
widespread than fasting.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> It is found throughout religious history
in the lowest tribes and in the most highly civilized peoples, has
been practiced in a great variety of circumstances, and has been
invested with a special sanctity and efficacy. It has been regarded
as necessary before partaking of sacred food, before the performance
of a sacred ceremony, after a death, in the presence of a
great occurrence (as an eclipse or a thunderstorm, regarded as
supernatural), as a part of the training of magicians, as a preparation
for the search after a guardian spirit, as a part of ceremonies
in honor of gods, as an act of abstinence in connection with a
calamity (or in general as a self-denial proper to sinful man and
pleasing to the deity as an act of humility), and, finally, as a retirement
from fleshly conditions in preparation for spiritual exercises.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_205" id="p_205">205</a></b>. A great number of explanations of the origin of the custom
have been proposed, and it is obvious that the particular usages
come from somewhat different conceptions. Apparently, however,
all these usages of purification by fasting go back to the idea that
the body, which is identified with the human personality, is in its
ordinary state nonsacred<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> and therefore unfit for the performance
of a sacred act, and that it is rendered especially unfit by contact
with a ritually unclean thing. Ordinary food, nourishing the body
and becoming a part of it, thus maintains it in its nonsacred character.
This point of view appears in the practice of administering
a purge as a means of ceremonial purification; the Nandi,
for example, give a purge to a girl before her circumcision, and in
some cases to any one who has touched a taboo object.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_206" id="p_206">206</a></b>. The essence of fasting is the avoiding of defiling food; this
conception may be traced in all instances of the practice, though
it may be in some cases re&euml;nforced by other considerations, and
is sometimes spiritualized. The efficacy of sacred food would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>destroyed if it came in contact with common food, or it might
itself become destructive.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> A sacred ceremony demands a sacred
performer, one who has not taken a defiling substance into his
being. Death diffuses defilement, and makes the food in the house
of the deceased dangerous.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_207" id="p_207">207</a></b>. Other ideas may here come in: abstinence may be a sign
or a result of grief, though this does not seem likely except in refined
communities; or its ground may be fear of eating the ghost,
which is believed to be hovering about the dead body;<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> it is hardly
the result of "making excessive provision for the dead."<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> Special
communion with supernatural Powers, by magicians and others
(including conditions of ecstasy), requires ritual purity, and similar
preparation of the body is proper when it is desired to avert the
anger of a deity or to do him honor.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_208" id="p_208">208</a></b>. Once established, the custom has maintained itself in the
higher religions<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> in connection with more or less definite spiritual
aims and with other exercises, particularly prayer. The dominant
feeling is then self-denial, at the bottom of which the conviction
appears to be that the deity demands complete subordination in
the worshiper and is displeased when he asserts himself. This
conviction, which is a fundamental element in all religious thought,
pertains properly only to inward experience, but naturally tends to
annex nonspiritual acts of self-abnegation like fasting. As a moral
discipline, a training in the government of self and a preparation
for enduring times of real privation, fasting is regarded by many
persons as valuable. Its power to isolate the man from the world
and thus minister to religious communion differs in different persons.
The Islamic fast of Ramadan is said to produce irritability and
lead to quarrels. In general, fasting tends to induce a nonnatural
condition of body and mind, favorable to ecstatic experiences, and
favorable or not, as the case may be, to a genuine religious life.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span><b><a name="p_209" id="p_209">209</a></b>. As with other religious observances, so with purificatory
ceremonies the tendency is to mass and organize them&mdash;they are
made to occur at regular times and under fixed conditions, as in
the Christian Lent, the Moslem Ramadan, and the Creek Busk.
Such arrangements give orderliness to outward religious life, but are
likely to diminish or destroy spontaneity in observances. Ceremonies
of this sort have great vitality&mdash;they are handed on from age to age,
the later religion adopting and modifying and reinterpreting the
forms of the earlier. In such cases the lower conceptions survive in
the minds of the masses, and are moralized by the more spiritual natures,
and their influence on society is therefore of a mixed character.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Ceremonies connected with Seasons and Periods</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_210" id="p_210">210</a></b>. Some of these have already been mentioned under "Economic
Ceremonies." We may here take a general survey of festivals
the times of whose celebration are determined by the divisions
of the year, and thus constitute calendars.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> The earliest calendars
appear to have been fixed by observation of the times when it was
proper to gather the various sorts of food&mdash;to hunt animals and
gather grubs and plants (as in Central Australia), or this or that
species of fish (as in Hawaii). The year was thus divided according
to the necessities of life&mdash;seasons were fixed by experience.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_211" id="p_211">211</a></b>. At a comparatively early period, however, the phases of
the moon attracted attention, and became the basis of calendars.
Lunar calendars are found among savage and half-civilized tribes
of various grades of culture in Polynesia, Africa, Asia, and the
Americas, and were retained for a time by most ancient civilized
peoples. Later observation included the movements of the sun;
it is only among advanced peoples that festivals are connected with
equinoxes and solstices. The more scientific calendars gradually
absorbed the earlier, and it is probable that simple ceremonies that
were originally neither agricultural nor astral were taken up into
the later systems and reinterpreted.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span><b><a name="p_212" id="p_212">212</a></b>. When, from observation of climatic conditions and lunar
changes, a general division of the year came to be made into spring,
summer, autumn, and winter, or several similar seasons (sometimes
with intermediate points), festivals gradually arranged themselves
in the various periods. The terms designating the four seasons
are, however, somewhat indefinite in regard to position in the
year and duration, varying in these points in different places, and
it is better, in considering agricultural ceremonies, to make a general
division into times of planting and times of harvesting. It is
not certain whether lunar or agricultural festivals came first in the
development of public religious life, but as (omitting the lowest
tribes) the former are found where there is no well-organized agricultural
system, we may begin with them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_213" id="p_213">213</a></b>. The new moon, as marking the beginning of the month,
and other phases of the moon are frequently accompanied by observances
of a more or less definitely religious character, with great
variety of detail in different places. The Nandi<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> have two seasons
(the wet and the dry) and twelve months named from meteorological
phenomena, and each day in the month receives a name from
the attendant phase of the moon. The great ceremonies are conducted
in the period of the waxing of the moon, and its waning is
an occasion of mourning. The new moon is greeted with a prayer
that it may bring blessing. A similar custom exists among the
Masai.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> On the other hand the Todas, though the times of their
festivals are all regulated by the moon, appear to have no lunar
ceremony;<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> if there was ever any such ceremony, it has been absorbed
by the buffalo cult. The South American Arawaks have six
ceremonies in the year that seem to be fixed by the appearance of
the new moon.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> The Hebrew first day of the (lunar) month was
observed with special religious ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> The full moon, the last
phase of growth, is less prominent; where it marks a festival day
it is generally in connection with an agricultural event, as among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>the non-Aryan Bhils of India<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> and in the later Hebrew calendar;<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
in both these cases the observance occurs only once in the year.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_214" id="p_214">214</a></b>. The new moon of the first month marks the beginning of
the year, and new year's day is celebrated, particularly in the more
advanced communities, with special observances. The Hindu <i>pongol</i>
and similar festivals are seasons of merriment, with giving of
presents, and religious exercises.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> Though these occasions now include
agricultural epochs, we may recognize in them an interest in
the beginning of a new era in life. A like character attaches to the
celebration of the Japanese new year's day.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> Of Assyrian observances
of the day little is known, but at Babylon it was celebrated
with great pomp, and with it was connected the conception of the
determination of human fortunes for the year by Marduk, the chief
deity of the city.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> The late Old Testament ritual makes it a taboo
day (first day of the seventh month, September-October); no servile
work is to be done, trumpets are to be blown (apparently to mark
its solemnity), and a special sacrifice is to be offered;<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> in post-Biblical
times the feature of the divine assignment of fates (probably
adopted from the Babylonians) appears. The old Roman religious
year began with the kalends of March, when the sacred fire of
Vesta was renewed, a procedure obviously intended to introduce a
new era; on the later civil new year's day (kalends of January)
presents were exchanged,<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> a custom everywhere relatively late, a
feature in the gradual secularization of ceremonies.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_215" id="p_215">215</a></b>. Solar festivals, as such, are less prominent than the lunar
in religious ritual. Though the sun was a great god widely worshiped,
it was little used in the construction of early calendars.
Primitive astronomy knew hardly anything of solstices and equinoxes,
and where these are noted in the more advanced rituals, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>appear to be attachments to observances founded on other considerations&mdash;so
the Roman Saturnalia, celebrated near the winter
solstice, and apparently the plebeian festival of the summer solstice
attached to the worship of Fortuna; and the same thing is probably
true of the Semitic and Greek festivals that occurred near the
equinoxes and solstices.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_216" id="p_216">216</a></b>. Elaborate solstitial ceremonies are practiced by the North
American Pueblos.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> A well-developed solar system of festivals
existed in Peru, where the sun was the central object of worship;
equinoxes and solstices were observed with great ceremonies, and
especially at the summer solstice the rising of the sun was hailed
with popular rejoicing as a sign that the favor of the deity would
be extended to the nation.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> Similar ceremonies may have existed
in Mexico and elsewhere, but in general, as is remarked above, the
astronomical feature at solar epochs yielded to other associations.
Occasional festivals occur in connection with the worship of stars
(especially the morning star);<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> the Pleiades are objects of observation
among some low tribes, and in some cases (Society Islands,
Tahiti, Hawaii, New Zealand) the year began with the rising of these
stars, but apparently no festivals are dedicated to them.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> In the later
theistic development various deities are brought into connection
with heavenly bodies, and their cults absorb earlier observances.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_217" id="p_217">217</a></b>. Socially the agricultural festivals are the most important
of the early festival ceremonies;<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> they unite the people in public
observances, thus furthering the communal life, and they satisfy
the popular demand for amusement. Doubtless under any social
conditions gatherings for merrymaking would have arisen, but, by
reason of the constitution of early society, they necessarily assume
a religious character. Whether for planting or for reaping, the local
god must be considered; it is he whose aid must be invoked for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>coming crops, and he must be thanked for successful seasons. The
festivals occur at various times in the year among various peoples,
but the tone of merriment is the predominant one&mdash;it is only in a
few cases that a touch of seriousness or sadness is found. Early
festal calendars are largely agricultural. In Greece, Rome, and Peru
there was a succession of festivals, connected with planting and
reaping, running substantially through the year; other ceremonies,
of course, stood side by side with them, but these were relatively few.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_218" id="p_218">218</a></b>. Joyous festivals occur especially at the time of the ripening
of crops and harvest. The old Canaanite autumn feasts, adopted
by the Hebrews, were seasons of good cheer.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> In Greece the Panathen&aelig;a
fell in July-August, the Thesmophoria in October, and
the Anthesteria in February,&mdash;all agricultural, with joyous features;<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>
of the similar Roman festivals the Feri&aelig; Latin&aelig; fell in
April, the Feri&aelig; Jovi in August, the Saturnalia in December, and
with these should perhaps be included the Ambarvalia (in May) and
the festival of the horse sacrifice (in October).<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> Other ceremonies
of this nature occur in India, New Zealand, Torres Straits islands,
and in the old Peruvian cult.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_219" id="p_219">219</a></b>. Popular festivities easily pass into license; examples are
the Roman Saturnalia and the Hindu Holi<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>; the harvest festival
of the Hos of Northeastern India is a debauch,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> and with it is
connected the expulsion of evil spirits&mdash;an example of the coalescence
of festivals. A peculiar feature in certain of these ceremonies
is the exchange of places between masters and servants;
this abandonment of ordinary social distinctions is an expression
of the desire for freedom from all restraints, and is found in
carnivals generally (in the Saturnalia and elsewhere).<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span><b><a name="p_220" id="p_220">220</a></b>. Ceremonies of a serious character occur in connection with
the eating of the first fruits of the year. In developed cults (as in
the Hebrew) the deity is recognized as the giver by the presentation
of a portion of the new crop.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> In very early cults there are other
procedures, the origin and significance of which are not always clear.
So far as the ceremonial eating, a preliminary to general use, is
concerned, this may be understood as a recognition, more or less
distinct, of some supernatural Power to whom (or to which) the
supply of food is due. The obscurest form of such recognition is
found among the Australian Arunta.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> The Nandi practice is clearer&mdash;the
god is invoked to bless the grain.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> In the Creek Puskita
(Busk) there is perhaps a worship of the sun as the source of fertility.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a>
Probably the element of recognition of extrahuman power (the
object being to secure its favor) is to be found in all first-fruits ceremonies.
A natural result of this recognition is that it is unlawful (that
is, dangerous) to partake of the new food till it has been properly
offered to the deity. The ceremonial features (such as the choice of
the persons to make the offering) are simply the carrying over of
general social arrangements into religious observances&mdash;the ministrant
is the father of the family, or the chief of the tribe, or the priest
or other elected person, according to the particular local customs.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_221" id="p_221">221</a></b>. The sadness or gloom that sometimes attaches to these
ceremonies has been variously explained, and is due doubtless to
various orders of ideas; it comes probably from the coalescence
of other cults with the agricultural cults proper. The remembrance
of ancestors is not unnatural at such a time, and sorrow may be expressed
for their death; such is perhaps the case in the Nandi
usage mentioned above&mdash;the women sorrowfully take home baskets
of elusine grain, and the bits that drop in the house are left to
the souls of the deceased. Sorrow appears also in other agricultural
seasons, as in the Roman Vestalia (in June) and the Greek
Thesmophoria (in the autumn), in which cases more likely it is
connected with the fear of evil influences.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> So the great tribal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>purification of the Creeks, at the beginning of a new year, naturally
coincides with the gathering of the new crop.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_222" id="p_222">222</a></b>. A further extension of the conception of the sacredness of
food (whether or not of the first eating) appears in the Mexican
custom (in May and December) of making dough images of gods,
the eating of which sanctifies the worshiper;<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> here the god dwells
in the bread of which he is the giver.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_223" id="p_223">223</a></b>. In addition to the astral and agricultural festivals above
described there has been the observance of long periods to which
a religious significance was sometimes attached. The Egyptian
Sothis period<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> (of 1461 years), the Greek period of eight years
(oktaeteris), and the Mexican period of fifty-two years were calendary&mdash;attempts
to harmonize the lunar and solar years; in Mexico
the new cycle introduced a new religious era&mdash;a great ceremony
was held in which domestic fires were rekindled from the sacred
fires. The Hebrew jubilee period (of fifty years), apparently a late
development from the sabbatical year, was intended, among other
things, to maintain the division of landed property among the people&mdash;all
alienated land was to return finally to its original owner&mdash;participation
in the blessings bestowed by the national deity being
conditioned on having a share in the land, of which he was held to
be the proprietor; the proposed arrangement turned out, however,
owing to changed social conditions, to be impracticable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_224" id="p_224">224</a></b>. It thus appears that ceremonies of various sorts have played
a very important part in religious life. They have been the most
popularly effective presentation of religious ideas, and they have
preserved for us religious conceptions that without them would have
remained unknown. Their social character has insured their persistence<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a>&mdash;ceremonies
of to-day contain features that go back to
the earliest known stratum of organized religious life. While the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>motives that underlie them (desire to propitiate supernatural
Powers, demand for an objective presentation of ideas, and love
of amusement) are the same throughout the world, their forms
reflect the various climatic, economic, and general cultural conditions
of clans, tribes, and nations. They acquire consistency with
the organization of society; they tend to become more and more
elaborate, just as in other points social intercourse tends to
produce formal definiteness; they grow decrepit and have to
be artificially strengthened and revived; they lose their original
meanings and must be constantly reinterpreted to bring them
into accord with new ideas, social, moral, and religious. Their
history, in a word, is the history of the development of human
ideas, and it sets forth the religious unity of the race. The selections
given above are only a small part of the known material,
a full treatment of which would require a separate volume.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>EARLY CULTS</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_225" id="p_225">225</a></b>. The lowest tribes known to us regard the whole world of
nature and the human dead as things to be feared and usually as
things to be propitiated. In most cases they conceive of some anthropomorphic
being as the creator or arranger of the world. But
in all cases they regard animals, plants, and inanimate objects as
capable of doing extraordinary things. All these beings they think
of as akin to men; transformations from human to nonhuman and
from nonhuman to human are believed to be possible and frequent.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_226" id="p_226">226</a></b>. From the point of view of the savage mind this theory
of the world is inevitable. Ignorant of what we call natural law,
they can see no reason why the phenomena of life should not be
under the control of any of the powers known to them; and for
sources of power they look to the things around them. All objects
of nature are mysterious to the savage&mdash;stones, hills, waters, the
sky, the heavenly bodies, trees, plants, fishes, birds, beasts, are full of
movement, and seemingly display capacities that induce the savage
to see in them the causes of things. Since their procedures seem to
him to be in general similar to his own, he credits them with a nature
like his own. As they are mysterious and powerful, he fears them and
tries to make allies of them or to ward off their injurious influences.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_227" id="p_227">227</a></b>. But while he excludes nothing from his list of possible
powers, he is vitally interested only in those objects with which
he comes into contact, and he learns their powers by his own
experience or through the wisdom inherited from his forefathers.
His procedure is strictly scientific; he adopts only what observation
has shown him and others to be true. Different tribes are
interested in different things&mdash;some are indifferent to one thing,
others to another, according to the topographical and economic
milieu. The savage is not without discrimination. He is quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
capable of distinguishing between the living and the dead. Not
all stones are held by him to be alive in any important sense, and
not all beasts to be powerful. He is a practical thinker and deals
with each phenomenon as it presents itself, and particularly as it
shows itself to be connected with his interests. He is constantly
on the alert to distinguish between the profitable and the unprofitable,
the helpful and the injurious. He himself is the center of his
whole scientific and religious system, and the categories into which he
divides all things are determined by his own sense of self-interest.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_228" id="p_228">228</a></b>. It is often by accident that one object or another displays
itself as helpful or harmful, just as, in a later and higher form of
religious belief, a theophany is often, as to time and place, a matter
of accident. Indeed, most manifestations of extrahuman power in
the earliest times may be said to come to man incidentally, since
he does not generally demand them from the gods or make experiments
in order to discover them. But in the nature of the case
many things meet him as to which he is obliged to use judgment,
and of these a certain number appear to him to be powerful.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_229" id="p_229">229</a></b>. These objects are held by him to be in some sort akin to
man. This seems to be his view of certain dead things in which a
mysterious power is held to reside. When such objects are parts
of animals (bones, feathers, claws, tails, feet, fat, etc.), or of vegetables
that are used as charms, it may be supposed that they simply
retain the power resident in the objects of which they are parts&mdash;objects
originally living and sacred. In other cases an indwelling
supernatural being is assumed, as, for example, in minerals whose
shape and color are remarkable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_230" id="p_230">230</a></b>. Fetish objects in West Africa are believed to be inhabited
by spirits.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> The Australian sacred object called <i>churinga</i>&mdash;a thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>of mysterious potency&mdash;is believed to be the abode of the soul
of an ancestor endowed with extraordinary power. Many such
fetish objects are found all over the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_231" id="p_231">231</a></b>. Further, the conception of a life-force, existing in many
things (perhaps in all things), appears to have been prominent in
savage religious systems. Life implies power; but while it is held
to reside in all things, its manifestations vary according to the
relations between things and human needs. The life-force in its
higher manifestations has been isolated in thought by some more
advanced savages, especially in North America and Polynesia, and
has been given a definite name; in Polynesia and Melanesia it is
called <i>mana</i>, and other names for it occur elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_232" id="p_232">232</a></b>. It shows itself in any object, nonhuman or human, that
produces extraordinary effects. In the Pacific islands all great
achievements of men are attributed to it&mdash;all great chiefs possess
it in an eminent degree;<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> it is then nearly equivalent to what we
call capacity or genius. When it resides in an inanimate thing it
may produce a physical effect: it comes up in the steam of the
American sacred sweat lodge, and gives health to the body (and
thus buoyancy to the mind);<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> here it is identical with the soothing
and stimulating power of the steam. It is, in a word, a term for
the force residing in any object.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> Like sickness and other evils,
blessings, and curses, it is conceived of as having physical form and
may be transmitted from its possessor to another person or object.
In some cases its name is given to the thing to which it is attached.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_233" id="p_233">233</a></b>. How widely the conception exists is uncertain; further
research may discover it in regions where up to now it has not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>been recognized. Scarcely a trace of it exists in the higher ancient
religions. The Latin <i>genius</i>, the indwelling power of the man, bears
a resemblance to it. The Old Testament "spirit of God" is said
to "come on" a man or to be "poured out on" him, as if it were
a physical thing&mdash;it gives courage and strength to the warrior and
knowledge to the worshiper;<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> the power or energy is here (in the
earlier Hebrew writings) identified with the spirit or animus of the
deity, which appears to be thought of as physical.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_234" id="p_234">234</a></b>. Mana is conceived of by the peoples mentioned above not
as a vague influence diffused through the world, but as a power
resident in certain definite persons or things. It is impersonal in
the sense in which any quality, as courage, is impersonal, but it
is not itself an object of worship; worship is directed toward the
thing that possesses or imparts mana. It may reside in a natural
object or in a supernatural being&mdash;the object will be used to secure
it, the supernatural being will be asked to bestow it. In both cases
the act will be religious.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_235" id="p_235">235</a></b>. Mana is itself, strictly speaking, a scientific biological conception,
but it necessarily enters into alliance with religion. Belief
in it exists along with belief in ghosts, spirits, and gods&mdash;it is not
a rival of these, but an attachment to them. As a thing desirable,
it is one of the good gifts that the great Powers can bestow, and
it thus leads to worship. It is found in distinct form, as is pointed
out above, only in superior tribes&mdash;it has not been discovered
in very low communities, and appears not to belong to the earliest
stratum of religious beliefs. But it rests on the view that all things
are endowed with life, and this view may be taken to be universal.
The doctrine of mana gradually vanishes before a better knowledge
of the human constitution,<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> a larger conception of the gods, and
a greater trust in them.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_236" id="p_236">236</a></b>. Things and persons endowed with peculiar power, whether
as seats of mana or as abodes of spirits, are set apart by themselves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>are regarded with feelings of awe, and thus become "sacred."
In process of time the accumulated experience of generations builds
up a mass of sacred objects which become a part of the religious
possessions of the community. The quality of sacredness is sometimes
attached to objects and customs when these are regarded
as necessary to the well-being of the community, or highly convenient.
A house, for example, represents the life of the family,
and is therefore a thing to be revered; and in many tribes the
walls, which guard the house against intrusion, and the door and
the threshold, which offer entrance into it, are considered sacred;
the hearth especially, the social center of the dwelling, becomes a
sacred place.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_237" id="p_237">237</a></b>. The savage communities with which we are acquainted all
possess their stock of such things&mdash;the beliefs concerning sacred
objects are held by all the members of the tribe. The development
of the idea of 'sacred' is a social communal one, but it is impossible
for us to say precisely how all the individual sacred objects
were selected, or what was the exact attitude of primeval man
toward all the things that are now regarded as sacred.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_238" id="p_238">238</a></b>. The conception of power resident in certain things to control
human life is represented by our term "luck." The formulation
of "luck" systems goes on in savage and half-civilized communities
up to a certain point, and is then checked by the rise of higher
religious ideas and by the growth of the conception of natural
law. But long after the grounds of belief in luck have ceased to
be accepted by the advanced part of the community, many individual
forms of good luck and bad luck maintain themselves in
popular belief.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> Some of these beliefs may be traced back to their
savage sources, especially those that are connected with animals;
the origin of most of them is obscure. They coalesce to some
extent with conceptions derived from magic, divination, and taboo.
The persistence of such savage dogma into civilized times enables
us to understand how natural this dogma was for early
forms of society.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_239" id="p_239">239</a></b>. In the practices mentioned above there is no worship proper.
Mana is not thought of as being in itself a personal power, and worship
is paid only to objects regarded as having personality. The
fetish derives its value from the spirit supposed to be resident
in the fetish objects; these are commonly worn as charms, and
the attitude of the man to such a charm, though he regards it as
powerful, seems to be not exactly that of worship&mdash;he keeps
it as a protection so long as it appears to be useful, but, as is
remarked above, he acts as if he were its master. He believes
that the efficient factor is the indwelling spirit, but he commonly
distinguishes between this spirit and a god proper. When, however,
the fetish is regarded as a tutelary divinity, it loses its lower
character and takes its place among the gods.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_240" id="p_240">240</a></b>. We turn now to man's attitude toward other objects, similarly
regarded as sacred, but invested with distinct personality, and
supposed to act consciously on human life. These are all such things
as men's experiences bring them into intimate relations with, this
relationship forming the basis of the high regard in which they are
held. They are animals, plants, mountains, rivers, heavenly bodies,
living men, and ghosts. These are objects of cults, many of them
in some cases being worshiped at the same time in a single community.
A chronological order in the adoption of such cults it is
not possible to determine. All objects stand together in man's consciousness
in early cultural strata, and the data now at command
do not enable us to say which of them first assumed for him a religious
character; the chronological order of cults may have differed
in different communities when the general social conditions were
different. We may begin with the cult of animals without thereby
assuming that it came first in order of time.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Animals</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_241" id="p_241">241</a></b>. Of all nonhuman natural objects it would seem to have
been the animal that most deeply impressed early man.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> All objects
were potentially divine for him, and all received worship, but none
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>entered so intimately into his life as animals. He was doubtless
struck, perhaps awed, by the brightness of the heavenly bodies, but
they were far off, intangible; mountains were grand and mighty,
but motionless; stones lay in his path, but did not approach him;
rivers ran, but in an unchanging way, rarely displaying emotion;
plants grew, and furnished food, but showed little sign of intelligence.
Animals, on the other hand, dwelt with him in his home,
met him at every turn, and did things that seemed to him to exhibit
qualities identical with his own, not only physical but also mental&mdash;they
showed swiftness, courage, ferocity, and also skill and cunning.
In certain regards they appeared to be his superiors, and
thus became standards of power and objects of reverence.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_242" id="p_242">242</a></b>. At a very early period the belief in social relations between
men and animals appears. The latter were supposed to have souls,
to continue their existence after death, sometimes to come to life
on earth after death. Their social life was supposed to be similar
to that of men;<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> in Samoa the various species form social units,<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>
the Ainu see tattoo marks on frogs and sparrows,<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> the Arabs recognize
a clan organization in beasts.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_243" id="p_243">243</a></b>. From identity of nature comes the possibility of transformation
and transmigration.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> An Australian of the Kangaroo clan
explained that he might be called either kangaroo or man&mdash;it was
all the same, man-kangaroo or kangaroo-man, and the Australian
legends constantly assume change from human to animal and from
animal to human.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> The same belief appears in Africa and North
America, and may be assumed to be universal among savages. It
survives in the Greek transformation stories and in the werwolf
and swan maiden of the European popular creed. It is the basis
of a part of the theory of the transmigration of souls.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span><b><a name="p_244" id="p_244">244</a></b>. The relations of early man with animals are partly friendly,
partly hostile. A friendly attitude is induced by admiration of their
powers and desire for their aid. Such an attitude is presupposed
in the myths of intermarriage between beasts and men. It is perhaps
visible also in the custom of giving or assuming names of
animals as personal names of men, though this custom may arise
from the opinion that animals are the best expressions of certain
qualities, or from some conception underlying totemistic organization;
the general history of savage proper names has not yet
been written. Beast tales, likewise, bear witness to man's opinion
of the cleverness or folly of his nonhuman brethren, and perhaps
originally to nothing more. The distinctest expression of friendliness
is seen in certain religious customs spoken of below.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_245" id="p_245">245</a></b>. On the other hand, early man necessarily comes into conflict
with animals. Against some of them he is obliged to protect
himself by force or by skillful contrivance; others must be slain
for food. With all of them he deals in such a way as to secure
his own well-being, and thus comes to regard them as things subservient
to him, to be used in such way as he may find profitable.
Those that he cannot use he gradually exterminates, or, at a later
stage, these, banished to thickets, mountains, deserts, caves, and
other inhospitable places, are excluded from human society and
identified with demons.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_246" id="p_246">246</a></b>. The two attitudes, of friendliness and of hostility, coexist
throughout the savage period, and, in softened form, even in half-civilized
life. They represent two points of view, both of which
issue from man's social needs. Early man is logical, but he comprehends
the necessity of not pushing logic too far&mdash;he is capable
of holding at the same time two mutually contradictory views, and
of acting on each as may suit his convenience; he makes his dogma
yield to the facts of life (a saving principle not confined to savages,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>but acted on to a greater or less extent by all societies). He slays
sacred animals for divinatory and other religious purposes, for food,
or in self-defense; he fears their anger, but his fear is overcome
by hunger; he offers profuse apologies, explains that he acts without
ill will and that the bones of the animal will be preserved and honored,
or he declares that it is not he but some one else that is the
slayer&mdash;but he does not hesitate to kill.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_247" id="p_247">247</a></b>. This fact&mdash;the existence of different points of view&mdash;enables
us to understand in part the disrespectful treatment of sacred
animals in folk-tales. Such tales are the product of popular fancy,
standing apart from the serious and solemn conceptions of the
tribal religion. The reciter, who will not fail at the proper time to
pay homage to his tribal patron, does not hesitate at other times
to put him into ridiculous and disgraceful situations.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_248" id="p_248">248</a></b>. Man's social contact with the lower animals is doubtless as
old as man himself, but there are no records of his earliest life, and
it is not possible to say exactly when and how his religious relations
with them began. His attitude toward them; as is remarked above,
was a mixed one; in general, however, it may be assumed that
constant intercourse with them revealed their great qualities and
impressed on him the necessity of securing their good will. This was
especially true of those of them that stood nearest to him and were
of greatest importance for his safety and convenience. These, invested
with mystery by reason of their power and their strangeness,
were held in great respect as quasi-gods, were approached with
caution, and thus acquired the character of sacredness. Gradually,
as human society was better and better organized, as conceptions
of government became clearer, and as the natures of the various
animals were more closely studied, means were devised of guarding
against their anger and securing their friendship and aid. Our
earliest information of savage life reveals in every tribe an inchoate
pantheon of beasts. All the essential apparatus of public
religion is present in these communities in embryonic form&mdash;later
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>movements have had for their object merely to clarify ideas and
refine procedures.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_249" id="p_249">249</a></b>. The animals revered by a tribe are those of its vicinage,
the inhabitants of its hunting grounds. Some of these man uses
as food, some he fears. His relation to plains, mountains, forests,
lakes, rivers, and seas, influences his choice of sacred beasts. Usually
there are many of them, and the natural inference is that originally
all animals are sacred, and that gradually those most important
for man are singled out as objects of special regard.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_250" id="p_250">250</a></b>. Thus, to mention the principal of them: in Africa we find
lion, leopard, hyena, hippopotamus, crocodile, bull, ram, dog, cat, ape,
grasshopper; in Oceania, kangaroo, emu, pig, heron, owl, rail, eel,
cuttlefish; in Asia, lion, elephant, bear, horse, bull, dog, pig, eagle,
tiger, water wagtail, whale; in Europe, bear, wolf, horse, bull, goat,
swan; in America, whale, bear, wolf, fox, coyote, hare, opossum,
deer, monkey, tiger, beaver, turtle, eagle, raven, various fishes.
The snake seems to have been generally revered, though it was
sometimes regarded as hostile.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> Since animals are largely valued
as food, changes in the animals specially honored follow on
changes in economic organization (hunting, pastoral, and agricultural
stages).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_251" id="p_251">251</a></b>. Often animals are looked on as the abodes or incarnations
of gods or spirits: so various birds, fishes, and beasts in Polynesia
(in Samoa every man has a tutelary deity, which appears in the
form of an animal<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a>), Siberia, Mexico, and elsewhere. In other
cases they are revered as incarnations of deceased men.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> Where a
species of animal is supposed to represent a god, this view is probably
to be regarded not as a generalization from an individualistic
to a specific conception (a process too refined for savages), but as
an attempt to carry over to the animal world the idea of descent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>from a common ancestor combined with the idea of a special
creator for every family of animals.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_252" id="p_252">252</a></b>. In the course of religious growth the beast-god may be
replaced or succeeded by an anthropomorphic god, and then the
former is regarded as sacred to the latter&mdash;the recollection of the
beast form still remains after the more refined conception has been
reached, and the two, closely connected in popular feeling, can be
brought into harmony only by making one subordinate to the other.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a>
A certain element or flavor of divinity clings to the beast a long
time, but finally vanishes under the light of better knowledge.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_253" id="p_253">253</a></b>. While the cases, very numerous, in which animals are associated
in worship with gods&mdash;in composite forms (as in Egypt,
Babylonia, and Assyria) or as symbols of deities or sacred to them&mdash;point
probably to early beast-cults, Egypt alone of the ancient
civilized nations maintained the worship of the living animal.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> For
the better thinkers of Egypt beasts doubtless were incarnations
or symbols of deities; but the mass of the people appear to have
regarded them as gods in their own persons.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_254" id="p_254">254</a></b>. Reverence for animals persists in attenuated form in civilized
nations in various superstitions connected with them. Their
appearances and their cries are believed to portend success or disaster.
The great number of "signs" recognized and relied on by uneducated
and educated persons at the present day bear witness to
the strong hold that the cult of animals had on early man.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_255" id="p_255">255</a></b>. It is in keeping with early ideas that savages often, perhaps
generally, ascribe the creation or construction of the world (so
far as they know it) to animals. The creation (whether by beasts or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>by other beings) is not conceived of as produced out of nothing;
there is always pre&euml;xisting material, the origin of which is not
explained; primitive thought seems not to have considered the
possibility of a situation in which nothing existed. The "creation"
conceived of is the arrangement of existing material into the forms
familiar to man&mdash;every tribe accounting thus for its own environment.
The origin of the land, of mountains, defiles, lakes, rivers,
trees, rocks, sun, moon, and stars, wind and rain, human beings
and lower animals, and sometimes of social organizations and
ceremonies, is explained in some way natural to the thought of
the time and place. Not all these details occur in the cosmogony
of every tribe or clan, but the purpose of every cosmogony
is to account for everything in the origin of which the people
are interested.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_256" id="p_256">256</a></b>. The creator in the cosmogonies known to us is not always
an animal&mdash;he is sometimes a man, sometimes a god; it is possible,
however, that human and divine creators are the successors
of original animal creators. In Central Australia the production of
certain natural features of the country and the establishment of
certain customs are ascribed to ancestors, mythical beings of the
remote past, creatures both animal and human, or rather, either
animal or human&mdash;possibly animals moving toward the anthropomorphic
stage.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> However this may be, there are instances in
which the creator is an animal pure and simple, though, of course,
endowed with extraordinary powers. The beast to which the demiurgic
function is assigned is selected, it would seem, on the ground
of some peculiar skill or other power it is supposed to possess;
naturally the reason for the choice is not always apparent. For
the Ainu the demiurge is the water wagtail;<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> for the Navahos
and in California,<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> the coyote or prairie wolf; among the Lenni-Len&acirc;p&eacute;,
the wolf.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> Various animals&mdash;as elephants, boars, turtles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>snakes&mdash;are supposed to bear the world on their backs. The
grounds of such opinions, resting on remote social conditions,
are obscure.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_257" id="p_257">257</a></b>. Though, in early stadia of culture, animals are universally
revered as in a sort divine, there are few recorded instances of
actual worship offered them.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> Whether the Bushmen and the Hottentots
worship the mantis (the Bushman god Cagn) as animal is
not quite clear.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> The bear, when it is ceremonially slain, is treated
by the Ainu as divine&mdash;it is approached with food and prayer,
but only for the specific purpose of asking that it will speak well
of them to its divine kin and will return to earth to be slain. The
Zu&ntilde;i cult of the turtle and the Californian worship of the bird called
<i>panes</i><a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> present similar features. The non-Aryan Santhals of Bengal
are said to offer divine worship to the tiger.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> Such worship appears
to be paid to the snake by the Naga tribes and the Gonds of India,
and by the Hopi of North America.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_258" id="p_258">258</a></b>. In these and similar cases it is sometimes difficult to say
whether the animal is worshiped in its own person merely, or as
the embodiment or representative of a god or of ancestors. The
usages in question are almost entirety confined to low tribes, and
disappear with the advance of civilization; wild animals are banished
from society and cease to be sacred, and the recollection of
their early character survives only in their mythological attachment
to deities proper. For a different reason domesticated animals lose
their sacredness&mdash;they become merely servants of men. The
Egyptian cult of the bull is the best-attested instance of actual
worship of a domestic animal, and parallels to this it is hard to
find; the Todas, for example, for whom the buffalo is the central
sacred object, do not now pay worship to the animal&mdash;they may
have done so in former times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span><b><a name="p_259" id="p_259">259</a></b>. The sacredness of animals, and the fact that they are regarded
as embodying the souls of things and human beings, have
led to a coalescence of their cults with other religious observances.
They are abundantly employed in magical procedures and in sacrifices;
they are often identified with spirits of vegetation, any locally
revered animal being chosen for this purpose; they are brought
into connection with astral objects and their forms are fancifully
seen in sun, moon, and constellations; they play a great r&ocirc;le
in apotropaic and purificatory ceremonies; and they appear in
myths of all sorts,<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> especially in the histories of gods.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_260" id="p_260">260</a></b>. But, though they are in many cases regarded as tutelary
beings, it is doubtful whether they ever develop into anthropomorphic
deities.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> The creation of such deities followed a different
line<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> and dispensed with the lower quasi-divine forms. Such manlike
attributes as beasts were supposed to have were taken up into
the distincter and nobler conceptions of tribal gods to whom beasts
were more and more subordinated. The latter were allegorized
and spiritualized, and came to serve merely as material for poetry.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_261" id="p_261">261</a></b>. Yet beast worship, such as it was and is, has played an
important part in religious development. It has furnished a point
of crystallization for early ideas, and has supplied interesting objects
in which man's demand for superhuman companionship could find
satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> It has disappeared when it has been no longer needed.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Plants</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_262" id="p_262">262</a></b>. The cult of plants has been as widespread as that of animals,
and, if its r&ocirc;le in the history of religion has been less important than
that of the latter, this is because plants show less definite signs of
life than animals and enter less intimately than they into the social
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>interests of man. But, like all other things, they are regarded by
early man as living, as possessing a nature similar to that of man,
and as having power to work good or ill. Trees are represented as
thinking, speaking, entering into marriage relations, and in general
doing whatever intelligent beings can do. Through thousands of
years in the period before the dawn of written history man was
brought into constant contact with the vegetable world, and learned
by experience to distinguish between plants that were beneficial and
those that were harmful. His observation created an embryonic
science of medicine, and his imagination an embryonic religious cult.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_263" id="p_263">263</a></b>. The value of certain vegetable products (fruits, nuts, wild
plants) as food must have become known at a very early time,
and these would naturally be offered to the extrahuman Powers.
At a later time, when cereals were cultivated, they formed an important
part of sacrificial offerings, and were held&mdash;as, for example,
among the Greeks and the Hebrews&mdash;to have piacular efficacy.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_264" id="p_264">264</a></b>. Among the discoveries of the early period was that of the
intoxicating quality of certain plants&mdash;a quality that came to play
a prominent r&ocirc;le in religious life. Valued at first, probably, for the
agreeable sensations they produced, such plants were later supposed
to possess magical power, to exert a mysterious influence on
the mind, and to be the source or medium of superhuman communications.
Thus employed by magicians they were connected with
the beginnings of religious ecstasy and prophecy. Their magical
power belongs to them primarily as living things, but came to be
attributed to extrahuman beings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_265" id="p_265">265</a></b>. Plants as living things were supposed to possess souls.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>
Probably the soul was conceived of at first as simply the vital
principle, and the power of the plant was thought of as similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>to the power of an animal or any other living thing. In the course
of time this soul, the active principle, was distinguished from the
vital principle, was isolated and regarded as an independent being
dwelling in the plant. To it all the powers of the latter were
ascribed, and it became a friend or an enemy, an object of worship
or of dread.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_266" id="p_266">266</a></b>. This difference of attitude on man's part toward different
plants probably showed itself at an early period. Those that were
found to be noxious he would avoid; the useful he would enter into
relations with, though on this point for very early times there is in
the nature of the case little information.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Unfriendly or demonic
spirits of plants are recognized by savage man in certain forests
whose awe-inspiring gloom, disease-breeding vapors, and wild beasts
repel and frighten him. Demons identified with plants or dwelling
in them are of the same nature as animal demons, and have been
dealt with in the same way as these.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_267" id="p_267">267</a></b>. The progress of society brought men into association with
useful plants, such as medicinal and edible herbs, and fruit-bearing
and shade-giving trees; these, conceived of as inhabited by anthropomorphic
spirits, fulfilled all the functions that attach to friendly
animals. They became guardians and allies, totems and ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a>
Several of the Central Australian totems are plants, and form part
of the mythical ancestral population constructed by the imagination
or ethnographic science of the people.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> In Samoa a plant is often
the incarnation of a spirit friendly to a particular family<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a>&mdash;a
conception that is not improbably a development from an earlier
view that a certain plant had a special relation to a certain clan.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>In general, a plant important in a given region (as, for example,
the tobacco plant in North America) is likely to be invested with
a sacred character.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_268" id="p_268">268</a></b>. Trees, by reason of their greater dignity (size, beauty, protective
character), have generally been singled out as special cultic
centers.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> A great tree sometimes served as a boundary mark or
signpost; under trees chiefs of clans sat to decide disputes. Thus
invested with importance as a sort of political center as well as the
abode of a spirit, a tree naturally became a shrine and an asylum.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a>
In India and Greece, and among the ancient Celts and Germans,
the gods were worshiped in groves, by the Canaanites and Hebrews
"under every green tree." To cut down a sacred tree was
a sacrilege, and the spirit of the tree was believed to avenge
the crime.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_269" id="p_269">269</a></b>. As might be expected, there is hardly a species of tree that
has not been held sacred by some group of men. The Nagas and
other tribes of Northeast India regard all plants as sacred,<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> and
every village has its sacred tree. In Babylonia and Assyria, it is
said, there were hundreds of trees looked on as invested with
more or less sanctity. The oak was revered in some parts of
Greece, and among the Romans and the Celts. The cult of particular
species, as the pipal (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), the vata or banyan
(<i>Ficus Indica</i>), the karam and others, has been greatly systematized
in India.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_270" id="p_270">270</a></b>. Vegetable spirits in some cases have developed into real
gods. A notable example of such growth is furnished by the history
of the intoxicating soma plant, which in the Rig-Veda is represented
not only as the inspiring drink of the gods but as itself a deity,
doing things that are elsewhere ascribed to Indra, Pushan, and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>well-established deities.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> The spirit, coming to be regarded as an
anthropomorphic person, under peculiar circumstances assumes the
character of a god. A similar development appears in the Iranian
haoma, and the cultic identity of soma and haoma shows that the
deification of the plant took place in the early Aryan period.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_271" id="p_271">271</a></b>. Another example has been supposed to be furnished by
corn-spirits. The importance of cereal crops for human life gave
them a prominent position in the cult of agricultural communities.
The decay and revival of the corn was an event of prime significance,
and appears to have been interpreted as the death and resurrection
of the spirit that was the life of the crop. Such is the idea
in the modern popular customs collected by Mannhardt and Frazer.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
The similarity between these ceremonies and those connected with
the Ph&oelig;nician Tammuz (Adonis) and the Phrygian Attis makes it
probable that the two are based on the same ideas; that is, that
Adonis and Attis (and so also Osiris and Ishtar) were deities of
vegetation. This, however, does not prove that they were developed
out of spirits of vegetation; they may have been deities charged
with the care of crops.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> The Ph&oelig;nician name Adon is merely a
title ('lord') that might be given to any god; he whom the Greeks
called Adonis was a Syrian local deity, identical in origin with the
Babylonian Tammuz, and associated in worship with Astarte, whom
the Greeks identified with their Aphrodite.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_272" id="p_272">272</a></b>. A sacred tree often stood by a shrine; that is, probably,
the shrine was put in the spot made sacred by a tree, and a ritual
connection between the two was thus established. Later, when a
shrine for any reason (in consequence of a theophany, for example)
was built where there was no tree, its place was supplied by a
wooden post, which inherited the cultic value of a sacred tree. In
the Canaanite cult, which was adopted by the Hebrews, the sacred
post (called "ashera") stood by the side of every shrine, and was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>denounced by the prophets as an accompaniment of foreign (that is,
non-Yahwistic) worship.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> The transition from tree to post is illustrated,
perhaps, by the conventionalized form of trees frequent on
Babylonian seal cylinders.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> How far the sacred post was an object
of worship by the people we have no means of knowing; but by
the more intelligent, doubtless, it came to be regarded simply as a
symbol, a sign of the presence of a deity, and was, in so far, in the
same category with images.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_273" id="p_273">273</a></b>. It is not impossible that totem posts may be connected with
original totem trees or other sacred trees. A tree as totem would
naturally be the object of some sort of cult, and when it took the
form of a post or pole, would have totemic symbols carved on it.
Oftener, probably, it was the sacred pole of a village (itself descended
from a sacred tree) that would be adorned with totemic
figures, as among the Indians of Northwestern America.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> In all
such cases there is a coalescence of totemism and tree worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_274" id="p_274">274</a></b>. It was natural in early times, when most men lived in forests,
which supplied all their needs, that trees should be looked on
as intimately connected with human life. A tree might be regarded
as in itself an independent personality, having, of course, a body
and a soul, but not as dependent on an isolated spirit. A group of
men might think itself descended from a tree&mdash;a conception that
may have been widespread, though there is little direct evidence of
its existence.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> Indirect evidence of such a view is found in the custom
of marrying girls to trees,<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> and in the belief in "trees of life,"
which are sometimes connected with individual men in such a way
that when the tree or a part of it is destroyed the man dies, as in
the case of Meleager whose life depended on the preservation of a
piece of wood,<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> the representative, probably, of a tree, and the priest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>of Nemi whose life was bound up in the "golden bough"<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a>; sometimes
the tree has a magical power of conferring life on whoever
eats of its fruit, as in the case of the tree of Eden.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_275" id="p_275">275</a></b>. These stories involve the conception of blood-kinship between
man and tree. Closely related to the "tree of life" is the
"tree of knowledge"&mdash;life is knowledge and knowledge is life. In
the original form of the story in Genesis there was only one tree&mdash;the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a>&mdash;whose fruit, if eaten,
made one the equal of the gods;<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> that is, the tree (in the original
form of the conception, in remote times) was allied in nature (that
is, in blood) to gods and to men, so that whoever partook of its
substance shared its attribute of knowledge in sharing its life, and
the command not to eat of it was due apparently to Yahweh's unwillingness
that man should equal the gods in knowledge. The
serpent-god, who belongs to the inner divine circle, but for some
unexplained reason is hostile to the god of the garden,<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> reveals
the secret.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_276" id="p_276">276</a></b>. Probably, also, it is from this general order of ideas that
the conception of the cosmic tree has sprung. The Scandinavian
Yggdrasil is the source of life to all things and represents also
wisdom; though the details may contain Christian elements, the
general conception of the world as a tree or as nourished by a
tree is probably old.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> The same conception appears in the cosmic
tree of India.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> Such quasi-philosophical ideas of the unity of the
life of the world suppose, doubtless, a relatively advanced stage of
culture, but they go back to the simple belief that the tree is endowed
with life and is a source of life for men. The transition
to the cosmic conception may be found in those quasi-divine
trees that grant wishes and endow their friends with wisdom
and life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span><b><a name="p_277" id="p_277">277</a></b>. The divinatory function of trees follows as a matter of
course from their divine nature (whether this was regarded as
innate or as due to an indwelling spirit). Their counsel was supposed
to be expressed by the rustling of their leaves,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> or in some
way that was interpreted by priests or priestesses (as at Dodona
and elsewhere) or by diviners (so, perhaps, the Canaanite "terebinth
of the diviners").<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> The predictions of the Cum&aelig;an sibyl
were said to be written on leaves that were whirled away by the
wind and had to be gathered and interpreted. To what method
of divination this points is not clear&mdash;possibly to supposed indications
in the markings of the leaves; it may, however, be merely
an imaginative statement of the difficulty of discovering the sibyl's
meaning.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_278" id="p_278">278</a></b>. The passage from the conception of the tree as a divine
thing or person (necessarily anthropomorphic) to the view that it
was the abode of a spirit was gradual, and it is not always easy
to distinguish the two stages one from the other. The tree-spirits,
in the nature of the case very numerous, were not distinguished
by individual names, as the trees were not so distinguished.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> The
spirits resident in the divine trees invoked in the Vedas are powerful,
but have not definite personality, and it is hard to say whether
it is the tree or the spirit that is worshiped. The Indian tree-spirits
called Nagas appear to be always nameless, and are not mentioned
in the list of deities that pay reverence to the Buddha (in the Maha
Samaya).<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> The large number of trees accounted sacred in Babylonia
were doubtless believed to be inhabited by spirits, but to no one
of these is a name given.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_279" id="p_279">279</a></b>. Thus the divine tree with its nameless spirit stands in a
class apart from that of the gods proper. A particular tree, it is
true, may be connected with a particular god, but such a connection
is generally, if not always, to be traced (as in the parallel case
of animals<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a>) to an accidental collocation of cults. When a deity has
become the numen of a tribe, his worship will naturally coalesce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>with the veneration felt by the tribe for some tree, which will
then be conceived of as sacred to the god. Such, doubtless, was
the history of the oak of Dodona, sacred to Zeus; when Zeus
was established as deity of the place, the revered tree had to be
brought into relation with him, and this relation could only be one
of subordination&mdash;the tree became the medium by which the god
communicated his will. There was then no need of the spirit of
the tree, which accordingly soon passed away; the tree had lost
its spiritual divine independence. The god who is said to have
appeared to Moses in a burning bush, and is described as dwelling
in the bush, is a local deity, the <i>numen loci</i> later identified with
Yahweh, or called an angel.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> That a tree is sacred to a god means
only that it has a claim to respect based on its being the property
or instrument of a god.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_280" id="p_280">280</a></b>. While the tree-spirit has undoubtedly played a great r&ocirc;le
in early religious history, there is not decisive evidence of its ever
having developed into a true god, with name, distinct personality,
and distinct functions.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> There are many Greek and Roman titles
that connect gods with trees,<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> but these may be explained in the
way suggested above: Zeus Endendros is a god dwelling in a tree,
but the tree is only an abode, not a god, and the god Zeus does
not come from the tree&mdash;rather two distinct sacred things have
been brought together and fused into a unity, or the tree is a rude,
incipient image. The Dionysos Hermes-figures may be explained
in the same way.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_281" id="p_281">281</a></b>. It appears to be the aloofness of trees that prevents their
becoming gods; they are revered and worshiped, but without becoming
personalities. Babylonian seal engravings and wall pictures
often represent a tree before which men or higher beings stand
in adoration; according to Maspero<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> there was actual worship of
trees in Egypt, and similar cults are found among the wild tribes
of India.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> Adoration, however, does not necessarily imply a god;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>the Buddhist's worship under the bo-tree is not directed to any
being; it is only the recognition of something that he thinks
worthy of reverence.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_282" id="p_282">282</a></b>. The cult of the corn-spirit is referred to above,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> and doubt
is there expressed as to whether such a spirit has grown into a
true god. The question is confessedly a difficult one on account
of the absence of full data for the period involved. The chief
ground for the doubt as to the development in question lies in
what we know of early gods. The term 'Adon,' as is remarked
above, is the Ph&oelig;nician title of the local deity. The origin of such
deities is involved in the obscurity of the remote past, but they are,
each in his community, universal powers; their functions embrace
all that their communities desire, and they represent each the total
life of a people. It is the general rule that any popular custom
may be introduced into the cult of the local god; of such sort
of procedure there are many examples. In the case under consideration
the god may have become the hero of a ceremony with
which he had originally nothing to do, as the Hebrews when they
entered Canaan connected Canaanite festivals with their national
god, Yahweh, and later a cult of the wilderness deity Azazel<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a>
was adopted and modified by the Yahwist leaders. Various cults
attached themselves to the worship of Zeus, Apollo, Dionysos, and
other Greek deities.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_283" id="p_283">283</a></b>. A similar explanation may be given of the ceremonies of
death and resurrection connected with Attis and Osiris. Of Attis
we have only late accounts, and do not know his early history.
Osiris is an old underground deity (later the judge of the Underworld),
with functions that included more than the vivification of
vegetation, and the absorption of the corn-spirit into his cult would
be natural. The collocation of a male with a female deity, common
to the three cults, may be merely the elaboration of the
myth in accordance with human social usage (the dead deity is
mourned by his consort).<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> The descent of Ishtar has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>interpreted of the weakening of the sun's heat in winter; but as
she is obviously a deity of fertility and, in her descent, disappears
entirely from among men, while the sun does not disappear entirely,
she rather, in this story, represents or is connected with the
decay and rebirth of vegetation.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_284" id="p_284">284</a></b>. It is thus possible that, though many ancient ceremonies
stand in relation to the corn-spirit and also to a god, the explanation
of this fact is not that the spirit has grown into a god, but
that it has coalesced with a god. In all such explanations, however,
our ignorance of the exact processes of ancient thought
must be borne in mind.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_285" id="p_285">285</a></b>. Trees have been widely credited with the power of bestowing
blessings of all sorts. But, like animals, they rarely receive
formal worship;<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> the reason for this is similar to that suggested
above<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> in the case of animals. The coalescence, spoken of above,
of tree ceremonies with cults of fully developed gods is not uncommon,
and trees figure largely in mythical divine histories.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Stones and Mountains</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_286" id="p_286">286</a></b>. Like all other objects stones have been regarded, in all
parts of the world, as living, as psychologically anthropomorphic
(that is, as having soul, emotion, will), and, in some cases, as possessing
superhuman powers.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> The term 'sacred,' as applied to
them, may mean either that they are in themselves endowed with
peculiar powers, or that they have special relations with divine
beings; the first meaning is the earlier, the second belongs to a
period when the lesser revered objects have been subordinated to
the greater.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_287" id="p_287">287</a></b>. The basis of the special belief in their sacredness was,
probably, the mystery of their forms and qualities, their hardness,
brilliancy, solidity. They seem to have been accepted, in the
earliest known stages of human life, as ultimate facts. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>explanations of their presence were sought, they were supposed
to have been deposited by ancestors or other beings, sometimes
as depositories of their souls.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> Meteorites, having fallen from the
sky, needed no other explanation. Popular science (that is, popular
imagination), perhaps from fancied resemblances to the human
form, assumed of some stones that they were human beings turned
to stone, and stories grew up to account for the metamorphoses.
In many different ways, according to differences of physical surroundings
and of social conceptions, men accounted for such of
these objects as interested them particularly.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_288" id="p_288">288</a></b>. That stones were believed to be alive and akin to men is
shown by the stories of the birth of men and gods from stones,<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a>
the turning of human beings to stone (Niobe, Lot's wife), the
accounts of their movements (rocks in Brittany).<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_289" id="p_289">289</a></b>. Small stones, especially such as are of peculiar shape, are
in many parts of the world regarded as having magic power;
the peculiarity of shape seems mysterious and therefore connected
with power. Doubtless accidental circumstances, such as the occurrence
of a piece of good fortune, have often endowed a particular
stone with a reputation for power. Certain forms, especially flat
disks with a hole in the center, have preserved this reputation
down to the present day. The Roman lapis manalis is said by
Festus to have been employed to get rain.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_290" id="p_290">290</a></b>. Magical stones were, doubtless, believed to possess souls.
In accordance with the general law such stones and others were
regarded later as the abodes of independent movable spirits.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>When the power of a fetish seems to be exhausted, and a new
object is chosen and by appropriate ceremonies a spirit is induced
to take up its abode in it, there seems to be no theory as to
whether the incoming spirit is the old one or a new one, or, if it
be a new one, what becomes of the old one, about which little or no
interest is felt.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> The pneumatology is vague; the general view is
that the air is full of spirits, whose movements may be controlled
by magical means: spirits, that is, are subject to laws, and these
laws are known to properly trained men.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_291" id="p_291">291</a></b>. Reverence for divine stones continues into the period of
the rise of the true gods. When god and stone stand together in
a community, both revered, they may be and generally are combined
into a cultic unity: the stone becomes the symbol or the
abode or the person of the god.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> It was, doubtless, in some such
way as this that a stone came to be identified with the Magna
Mater of Pessinus. When this stone was brought to Rome toward
the end of the Second Punic War, the Roman leaders may have
regarded it simply as a symbol of the goddess, but the people
probably looked on it as itself a divine defense against Hannibal.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a>
The Israelite ark, carried out to the battle against the Philistines,<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a>
appears to have contained a stone, possibly a meteorite, possibly
a piece taken from the sacred mountain Sinai, itself divine, but in
the Old Testament narrative regarded as the abode of Yahweh (a
Sinaitic god), though it was probably of independent origin and
only gradually brought into association with the local god of the
mountain.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_292" id="p_292">292</a></b>. Similar interpretations may be given of other stones identified
or connected with deities, as that of Zeus at Seleucia,<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> that
of Aphrodite at Paphos,<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> that of Jupiter Lapis,<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> and the black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>stone that represented the Syrian Elagabalos at Emesa.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> The
remark of Pausanias, after he has described the thirty sacred
stones of Pher&aelig;, that the early Greeks paid divine honors to unhewn
stones, doubtless expresses the traditions and beliefs of his
time;<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> and it is probable that in antiquity there were many divine
stones, and that these were frequently in later times identified with
local gods. In many cases, however, there was no identification,
only a collocation and subordination: the stone became the symbol
of the deity, or a sacred object associated with the deity.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_293" id="p_293">293</a></b>. This seems to be the later conception of the character of
the sacred stones mentioned in the Old Testament, as the one
that Jacob is said to have set up as a masseba and anointed.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>
The Canaanite massebas, adopted as cultic objects by the Israelites,<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a>
were stone pillars standing by shrines and regarded as a
normal if not a necessary element of worship; originally divine in
themselves (as may be inferred from the general history of such
objects), they came to be regarded as mere accessories; there is
no indication in the Old Testament that they were looked on as
gods, though they may have been so regarded by the people<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a>&mdash;their
presence at the Canaanite shrines, as a part of foreign, non-Yahwistic
worship, sufficiently explains the denunciation of them
by the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_294" id="p_294">294</a></b>. In the story of Jacob he is said to have given the name
Bethel to the place where he anointed the stone. It does not
appear that he so called the stone itself; Bethel (in Hebrew,
"house of God"<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a>) seems to have been an old sacred place, and
terms compounded with 'beth' in Hebrew are names of shrines.
The relation between this name and the Semitic word whence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>probably, comes Greek <i>baitulos</i><a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> (Latin <i>baetulus</i>) is not clear;
this last is the designation of a sacred stone held to have fallen
from heaven (meteoric). Such an one is called by Philo of Byblos
"empsuchos," 'endowed with life or with soul.'<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> Pliny describes
the baetulus as a species of ceraunia (thunderstone).<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> The
Greek word is now commonly derived from <i>betel</i> ('bethel')&mdash;a
derivation possible so far as the form of the word is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a>
According to this view the stone is the abode of a deity&mdash;a conception
common in early religion. Such an object would be
revered, and would ultimately be brought into connection with a
local god.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> If Hebrew bethel was originally a stone considered
as the abode of a deity, then in the Old Testament the earlier
form of the conception has been effaced by the later thought&mdash;the
word 'bethel' has become the name of a place, a shrine, the
dwelling place of God.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_295" id="p_295">295</a></b>. The origin of the black stone of the Kaaba at Mecca is unknown&mdash;it
was doubtless either a meteorite or in some way connected
with a sacred place; it was, and is, regarded as in itself
sacred, but whether it represented originally a deity, and if so what
deity, is not known.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_296" id="p_296">296</a></b>. The belief in the sacred character of stones may account,
at least in part, for the custom of casting stones on the grave of a
chieftain (as in Northern Arabia), though this may be merely intended
to preserve the grave. So also the stones thrown at the
foot of a Hermes pillar may have been meant as a waymark, yet
with the feeling that the stone heap had a sacred character of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>own.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> The stone circles at Stonehenge and Avebury may have had
a religious significance, but their function is not clear. Boundary
stones seem to have had at first simply a political function, but
were naturally dedicated to the deities who were guardians of
tribal boundaries (Roman Terminus, various Babylonian gods, etc.).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_297" id="p_297">297</a></b>. It is by virtue of their divine character that stones came
to be used as altars.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> As things divine in themselves or as representing
a deity they receive the blood of the sacred (that is, divine)
sacrificial animal, which is the food of the god. Originally a part of
the blood is applied to the stone, and the rest poured out or eaten
(as sacred food) by the worshiper. In process of time, when the
god has been divorced from the stone, the latter becomes a table
on which the victim is offered;<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> the old conception survives in the
custom of slaying the victim by the side of the altar, and applying
the blood to the horns of the altar as a representative part of the
sacred structure. In the late Jewish ritual this application of blood is
interpreted as a purification of the altar from ceremonial defilements.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_298" id="p_298">298</a></b>. Originally, it seems, it was only natural stones that were
sacred or divine and were employed as representatives of deities;
but by a natural process of thought the custom arose of using artificial
stones in the same way. By means of certain ceremonies, it was
held, the deity could be induced to accept an altar or a house, or to
take up his abode in an image, as a spirit is introduced by the savage
into a fetish object.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> The basis of this sort of procedure is first the
belief in the amenableness of the deity to magical laws, and, later,
the belief in his friendly disposition, his willingness to accede to the

even in very late ceremonies a trace of the magical element remains.</p>

Solomon's temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, and the temple planned

these pillars that which regards them as phallic symbols may be set
aside as lacking proof.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> It is not probable that they were merely
decorative; the details of ancient temples, as a rule, were connected
with worship. It has been suggested that they were fire
altars,<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> in support of which view may be cited the figures on Cyprian
coins (mentioned above), and the fact that sailors sacrificed at Gades
at a place where there were two high pillars;<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> but such a custom
does not prove that the sacrifices were offered on the pillars, and
these latter are generally too high to serve such a purpose; they
are too high also to be convenient candelabra.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> It seems more probable
that they were developments from sacred stones (such as the
Canaanite massebas), which originally represented the deity, came
to be conventional attachments to temples, and then were treated
in accordance with architectural principles. They would be placed
in pairs, one pillar on each side of the temple door, for the sake of
symmetry, and dignity would be sought by giving them a considerable
height.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> They might also be utilized, when they were not
too high, as stands for lamps or cressets, but this would be a secondary
use. The obelisks that stood in front of Egyptian temples, likewise,
were probably sacred monuments reared in honor of deities.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span><b><a name="p_300" id="p_300">300</a></b>. Images of gods and other extrahuman beings arise through
the natural human impulse to represent familiar objects of thought.
Very rude tribes have stone or wood carvings of spirits and gods,
good and bad. These images are generally in human shape, because
all Powers are thought of as anthropomorphic. Sometimes, as
R&eacute;ville suggests, a root, or branch of a tree, bearing some resemblance
to the human face or figure, may have led to the making of
an image; but the general natural artistic tendency is sufficient to
account for the fact.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_301" id="p_301">301</a></b>. The character assigned to images varies with stages of culture.
In low communities they are themselves divine&mdash;the gods
have entered into them and they are not thought of as different
from their divine indwellers. In such cases they are sometimes
chained to prevent their getting away; if they are obstinate, not
listening to prayers, they are cuffed, scourged, or reviled.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> This conception
lingers still among the peasants of Southern Europe, who
treat a saint (a rechristened old god) as if he were a man to be won
by threats or cajolements. In a more refined age the image becomes
simply a symbol, a visible representation serving to fix the
attention and recall divine things. Different races also differ in the
extent of their demand for such representations of deity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_302" id="p_302">302</a></b>. Stones and rocks, like other natural objects, are starting-points
for folk-stories and myths. All over the world they lie on
the ground or rise in the shape of hills, and, being mysterious,
require explanation. The explanations given, and handed down
from generation to generation, are always connected with superhuman
or with extraordinary persons, ancestors, heroes, spirits. To
each stone or rock a story is attached, a creation of the fancy suggested
by the surroundings and by the popular traditions; and each
story forms an episode in the history of the hero or spirit. The
stones and rocks thus come to constitute a book chronicling the
history of the tribe and the deeds of its great men&mdash;a book quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>legible to the man who has been taught the stories. These grow
with every generation, receiving such additions as fancy and reflection
dictate, and gradually taking on literary form. In the territory
of the Australian Arunta every stone is connected with some incident
in the careers of the mythical ancestors, and the stories taken
together form the legendary history of the origin of customs.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> In
Samoa and New Guinea many stones are pointed out as having
been set in place by local heroes. In North America innumerable
rocks and stones are connected with the mythical ancestors and
creators of the tribes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_303" id="p_303">303</a></b>. Mountains have everywhere been regarded as abodes of
spirits or deities, and therefore sacred. Their height and massiveness
invested them with dignity (even as now they appeal mightily
to the imagination), and their lofty summits and rugged sides were
full of danger and mystery. Sacred mountains are found in North
America, Bengal, Africa, and elsewhere. Naturally they are often
abodes of gods of rain; they are feared on account of the spirits inhabiting
them, but they are also resorted to as places where divine
revelations may be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> The Semitic, Hindu, and Greek examples
are familiar: the Hebrew and Canaanite Sinai (or Horeb),
Nebo, Carmel, Hermon; the Arabian Arafat, near Mecca; the
Babylonian Ekur; in India, Meru, Mandara, Himavat, and other
mountains; in Greece, Olympus and Parnassus.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_304" id="p_304">304</a></b>. Mountains are also worshiped as being themselves divine.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a>
The cult, however, has not been important; the physical mass is
too solid, lacking in movement, and human interest naturally centered
in the spirit or deity who dwelt therein.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_305" id="p_305">305</a></b>. Mythological fancy has made them the abodes and places
of assembly of gods and glorified saints, usually in the north. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>mythical Ekur was the dwelling place of Babylonian deities.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> In
India various peaks in the Himalayas, inaccessible to men, were
assigned to groups of deities, and the mythical world-mountain
Meru was the special abode of great gods, who there lived lives
of delight.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> On the highest peak of the Thessalian Olympus Zeus
sat, surrounded by the inferior gods; here he held councils and
announced his decrees.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> The two conceptions of the home of
the gods&mdash;on mountains and in the sky&mdash;existed for a time
side by side, having in common the feature of remoteness and
secrecy; gradually the earthly abode was ignored, and the gods
were assigned to the more dignified heavenly home.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Waters</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_306" id="p_306">306</a></b>. To early man waters, fire, winds, are interesting because
of their relation to his life, and sacred because of their power and
mysteriousness.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> They are regarded by him not as "elements" of
the world, but as individual phenomena that affect well-being. His
conception of them is not cosmogonic or analytic, but personal;
they are entities with which he has to deal.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_307" id="p_307">307</a></b>. The mobility of masses of water, seeming to be a sign of
life, naturally procured them a definite place among sacred things.
Any spring, pond, lake, or river with which a tribe was brought
into intimate relations was regarded as a source of life or of healing,
and of divination. Dwellers by the sea regarded it with awe;
its depths were mysterious and its storms terrible.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_308" id="p_308">308</a></b>. As in the case of animals, plants, and stones, so here: the
earliest conception of water masses is that they are divine in themselves
(every one, of course, having its own soul), and are potent
for bodily help or harm, and for divination. The waters of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>Nile, the Ganges, the Jordan, were held to heal the diseased and
purify the unclean; and a similar power is now ascribed to the
water of the well Zamzam in the Kaaba at Mecca. Hannibal
swore, among other things, by the waters,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> and the oath by the
river Styx was the most binding of oaths, having power to control
even the gods; the thing by which an oath is taken is always
originally divine. In the Hebrew ordeal of jealousy the sacred
water decides whether the accused woman is guilty or not.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> The
sea is treated as a living thing, whose anger may be appeased by
gifts; it is a monster, a dragon.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> The Spartan Cleomenes, about
to start on a voyage, sacrifices a bull to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> Offerings to the
sea are made in the Maldive Islands.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_309" id="p_309">309</a></b>. Water is abundantly employed in religious ritual as a means
of purification from ceremonial defilement, and in services of initiation.
A bathing-place often stood by a shrine (as in pre-Islamic
Arabia and in Islam now), and immersions came to play a prominent
part in highly developed systems (Jewish, Christian, Mithraic).
The purification was generally symbolic, but in some forms of Christian
belief the water of baptism is held to have regenerating power<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a>&mdash;a
survival of the ancient conception of the divinity of water.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_310" id="p_310">310</a></b>. It is often hard to say whether a body of water is regarded
simply as itself a living thing, or is conceived of as the dwelling
place of an isolated or independent spirit. In savage systems the
details on this point are hardly ever recorded or obtainable; but
the beliefs involved in later folk-lore make it probable that this latter
stage of the construction of creeds is passed through in savage life.
The water maidens of Greek mythology and the Germanic nixies
and water kelpies are developed forms of spirits. Sacred springs
and wells are still believed to be inhabited by beings that are not
gods, but possess superhuman power.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_311" id="p_311">311</a></b>. While wells and streams of a domestic character (such as
are freely used by human beings) are generally friendly, they have
their unfriendly side. The spirits that dwell in them are sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>regarded as being hostile to man. They drag the incautious
wanderer into their depths, and then nothing can save him from
drowning. Fear of these malignant beings sometimes prevents attempts
to rescue a drowning person; such attempts are held to bring
down the vengeance of the water-demon on the would-be rescuer.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_312" id="p_312">312</a></b>. In the course of time true water-gods appear. In Greece
every river had its deity, and in India such deities are found in
the Mahabharata.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> When in the Iliad the river Xanthos rises to
seize and drown Achilles, it may be a question whether the stream
or the god of the stream is the actor. Nor is it always possible to
say whether the extrahuman Power inhabiting a water mass is a
true god or a spirit; the latter form may pass by invisible gradations
into the former.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_313" id="p_313">313</a></b>. Waters originally divine tend to become the abodes of the
deity of the place, or sacred to him, and healing or other power is
ascribed to his presence or agency.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> Sacred water, being unwilling
to retain anything impure, thus becomes a means of detecting
witches and other criminals, who, when thrown in, cannot sink, but
are rejected by the divine Power.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_314" id="p_314">314</a></b>. Deities of streams and springs do not play an important
part in worship or in mythology; their physical functions are not
definite enough, and their activities are naturally merged in or subsumed
under those of the greater or more definite local gods. If,
for example, the Canaanite Baals are gods or lords of underground
irrigation,<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> this is because they, as divine lords of the particular
regions, control all phenomena; they are, in fact, also gods of rain
and thunderstorms, harvests and war. So rain-gods in general are
to be regarded as local deities, among whose functions that of bestowing
rain was regarded as specially important. In the lowest systems
the rain-giver may be a sacred stone, dipped in a stream,<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> or a
royal or priestly magician who is held responsible and is punished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>if the expected result is not attained.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> In such cases the procedure
is often one of imitative magic.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_315" id="p_315">315</a></b>. If there be, in the next higher stratum of belief, a local
or tribal god, it is he who is looked to for the rain supply; so the
early Hebrews looked to Yahweh,<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> and the Canaanites, doubtless, to
the Baals. The economic importance of rain led, even in low tribes,
to the conception of a special deity charged with its bestowal.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> In
more elaborate mythologies various deities are credited with rain-making
power. In India, for example, Dyaus, the Maruts, Parjanya,
Brihaspati, Indra, Agni,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> all concerned with rain, have, all
except Agni, evidently grown from local figures with general functions;
this appears from the great variety of parts they play. The
same thing is true, perhaps, of Zeus and Jupiter in their character
of rain-gods&mdash;as all-sufficient divine patrons they would be dispensers
of all blessings, including rain; they seem, however, to
have been originally gods of the sky, and thus naturally the
special guardians of rain.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_316" id="p_316">316</a></b>. Great masses of water have given rise to myths, mostly
cosmogonic. The conception of a watery mass as the primeval
material of the world (in Egypt, Babylonia, India, Greece, Rome)
belongs not to religion but to science; in a relatively advanced
period, however, this mass was represented as a monster, the
antagonist of the gods of light and order, and from this representation
has come a whole literature of myths. In Babylonia a
great cosmogonic poem grew up in which the dragon figures of
the water chaos (Tiamat, Mummu, Kingu) play a great part,<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a>
and echoes of this myth appear in the later Old Testament books.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span><b><a name="p_317" id="p_317">317</a></b>. In the more elaborate pantheons the local deities of streams
and springs tend to disappear, and gods of ocean appear: in Babylonia,
Ea; in Greece, Okeanos and Poseidon; in Rome, Neptune;
and along with these are numerous subordinate figures&mdash;attendants
on the great gods, and intrusted with various particular duties.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Fire</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_318" id="p_318">318</a></b>. There was, doubtless, a time when man had not learned to
produce fire, and there may now be tribes unacquainted with its
domestic uses. But such ignorance, if it exists, is rare; savages
generally know how to make fire, and to use it for warmth and for
the preparation of food. When men began to reflect on the origin
of things, fire seemed to them so wonderful that they supposed it
must have been discovered or invented, and the knowledge of it
bestowed on men by higher beings, gods or demigods; such benefactors
are Hastsezini (of the Navahos), Lightning (of the Pawnees),
the Beaver and the Eagle (of the Thompson River Indians
of British Columbia), Maui (of the Maoris), Agni, Prometheus.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_319" id="p_319">319</a></b>. Though, like other mysterious things, it has been regarded
generally (perhaps universally) as sacred, there is no clear proof
that it has been worshiped as divine. What may have been the
case in remote ages we cannot tell, but, according to the information
we possess, it has been, and is, merely revered as in itself mysterious
or sacred,<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> or as the abode or production of a spirit or a
deity. Possibly in the early stages of culture known to us there is a
fusion of the element with the indwelling or controlling god or spirit.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a>
The divine patrons of fire are found in all parts of the world, varying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>in form and function according to the degrees of advancement of the
various communities, from the beast-gods of the Redmen to the departmental
deities of the Maoris, Babylonians, Mexicans, and others,
and to the more complicated gods of Hindus, Greeks, and Romans.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_320" id="p_320">320</a></b>. The most elaborate and most interesting of all fire-cults is
the Persian. The ritual of the Avesta appears at times to describe
a worship of the element itself: in Fargard xviii the fire implores
the householder to rise, wash his hands, and put pure wood on the
flame; Ya&ccedil;na lxi is a hymn of homage and petition addressed to
the fire, which is called the son of Ahura Mazda&mdash;the householder
asks that all the blessings of life may be his as a reward for his
sacrifice. The numerous temples devoted to the fire-cult, mentioned
by later writers,<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> might seem to look in the same direction.
But a comparison of other parts of the Avesta makes it doubtful
whether in the passages just cited anything more is meant than that
the fire, as a creation of Ahura Mazda and sacred to him, is for his
sake worthy of reverence and through him a source of blessing.
Thus Ya&ccedil;na xvii is a hymn in honor of Ahura Mazda and all his
creatures, among which are mentioned the law of Zarathustra, the
fire (and five different fires are named), the soul of the ox, and pure
deeds, along with the Amesha-spentas, the heavenly bodies, and
good men. This collection shows vagueness in the conception of the
divine and the sacred, and, to say the least, leaves it uncertain
whether the singer does not think of the fire simply as a symbol of
the Supreme God.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_321" id="p_321">321</a></b>. The relation of fire to the gods, and especially its use in
sacrifice, have led to a number of religious ceremonies in which it
plays a principal part.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> Certain fires must be kindled by specially
appointed sacred persons: among the Todas of Southern India,
when a new dairy is visited or an old dairy is reconsecrated;<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>the Lacandones of Central America, on the occasion of the renewal
of the incense-bowls;<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> in the Peruvian temple at the feast of
Raymi, when the flame was intrusted to the care of the Virgins
of the Sun, and was to be kept up during the year;<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> in the temples
of Hestia and Vesta; throughout Greece, when the fires had been
polluted by the presence of the Persians, it was ordered that they
should be put out and rekindled from the sacred fire at Delphi.<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_322" id="p_322">322</a></b>. The purificatory power of fire was, doubtless, a fact of early
observation.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_323" id="p_323">323</a></b>. As the physical means of sacrifice, fire acquired a certain
symbolic significance; in the Hebrew ritual "fire-offerings" are regarded
as specially important. By Carthaginians, Moabites, and
Hebrews children were devoted to the deity by fire.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_324" id="p_324">324</a></b>. By reason of its brightness fire connects itself in religious
imagery with the sun, with lightning, and with light in general, and
so appears frequently as a representation of the glory of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_325" id="p_325">325</a></b>. Light is sometimes regarded as an independent thing, and
as sacred.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Winds</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_326" id="p_326">326</a></b>. Traces of an early cult of the physical wind may be found,
perhaps, in certain customs that survive in modern communities;
as, for example, in the offering of food to the wind that it may be
placated and do no harm.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> The belief of sailors that wind may be
called up by whistling rests on a process of imitative magic that
may be connected with an early cult. Wind is said to be regarded
as a divine being in some American tribes.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> But generally it is the
spirit or god of a wind (and usually of a definite wind) that is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>invoked. Examples of wind-gods are found in all parts of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> A wind may be the vehicle or the messenger of a deity.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_327" id="p_327">327</a></b>. As in the cases of other elements, referred to above, it is
often hard to say whether it is the thing or the deity that is invoked:
Achilles's appeal, for instance, seems to be to the physical winds,
but Iris, who goes to summon them, finds them carousing like men,
and they act like gods.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> It must be borne in mind, however, that
in early thought all active things are conceived of as being anthropomorphic,
and there is the difficulty, just mentioned, of determining
where the anthropomorphic object stops and the spirit or god begins.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Heavenly Bodies</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_328" id="p_328">328</a></b>. The heavenly bodies seem to have been regarded at first
merely as objects somehow thrown up into the sky or in some
other way fixed there by gods or men.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> Later, under the general
anthropomorphizing tendency, they are conceived of as manlike
beings, and their characters and histories are worked out in accordance
with local ideas. Their origin is ascribed at first to such
creative beings as appear in the various early communities; for
example, among the Navahos to the First Man, the First Woman,
and the coyote.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_329" id="p_329">329</a></b>. In half-civilized peoples elaborate cosmogonies arise, in
which the sky is introduced along with sun, moon, and stars.
The most noteworthy of these representations of the origin of
the sky is one that occurs in almost identical forms in Egypt and
New Zealand, among the Masai of Central East Africa, and elsewhere:
two beings lie in marriage embrace&mdash;one is lifted up and
stretches from horizon to horizon as the sky, the other remains as
the earth.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> The sun is commonly male but sometimes female,<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>there is also diversity of views as to the sex of the moon. The stars
are often called the children of the sun and moon.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_330" id="p_330">330</a></b>. Savage fancy sees in the groups of stars resemblances to
human persons and objects.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> Such resemblances are worked out
by civilized peoples, a descriptive science of constellations arises,
and stories are invented to explain the origin of their names. These
stellar myths, brought into connection with others, play a great part
in developed mythologies.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_331" id="p_331">331</a></b>. Among higher communities there are diverse conceptions
of the sex of the great luminaries. The word for 'sun' is feminine
in Sanskrit, Anglo-Saxon, German, and often in Hebrew; masculine
in Babylonian, Assyrian, Greek, and Latin. 'Moon' is masculine in
Anglo-Saxon and German, and generally in Sanskrit and the Semitic
languages; feminine in Greek and Latin. The reasons for these
differences are to be sought in the economic relations of the communities
to sun and moon, and in the play of imagination, but the
history of the variations is not clear. One proposed explanation
is that to those who traveled by night on land or on sea the moon
was the strong guide and patron, and by day the sun appeared as a
splendidly beautiful woman. Other explanations have been offered,
but no general determining principle can be stated.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_332" id="p_332">332</a></b>. The early anthropomorphic figures of sun and moon appear
to be on the verge of becoming true gods. It is, however, often
difficult to decide whether in the widespread veneration of the sun
it is to be regarded as a living thing (it is frequently represented
as a man, a great chief,<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> dwelling in the sky), or a physical object
inhabited by a spirit, or a fully developed god.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> The transition to
the higher conception is gradual, and will be discussed below,<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> along
with the representations of the moon and the stars.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_333" id="p_333">333</a></b>. The view that the sky and the earth are the original progenitors
of things appears among many peoples, low and high
(notably among the Chinese); the two are sometimes taken for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>granted, but it is probable that there were always stories accounting
for their origin. The sky is sometimes female, usually in the
older myths (Maori, Egyptian), sometimes male (Greek, Roman).<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_334" id="p_334">334</a></b>. Thunder and lightning are regarded in early systems of
thought as independent things, only locally or accidentally combined.
They are awful and terrible to savage feeling,<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> but they
have never received religious worship. A quasi-scientific explanation
of thunder found among certain peoples (North American,
Brazilian, Bakuana, Karen, and others) is that it is produced by
the flapping of the wings of a mighty bird.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> More commonly
thunder is the voice of a deity, and lightning is his arrow,<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> or
these are said simply to be sent by a god.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Worship of Human Beings</span><a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_335" id="p_335">335</a></b>. We might naturally suppose that human beings, as well
as animals, plants, and inanimate things, would be objects of religious
reverence to undeveloped communities; men, it might seem,
would be thought worthier objects of worship than beasts, plants,
and stones. In fact, the cult of human beings has been and is
widespread, but in this cult the savage mind makes a sharp distinction
between the living and the dead. Living men are tangible
and intelligible, affected with human frailties, and therefore offer
less food for the imagination than beasts; the souls of dead men
are remote, intangible, mysterious, and it is they that have most
inspired religious emotion. The history of these cults is in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>points obscure; though many facts have been collected, the data
are not full and exact enough to furnish a complete explanation
of the details of usage, diffusion, origin, and development.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Cult of the Living</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_336" id="p_336">336</a></b>. Savages appear to put no limit to the possible powers of
men. In the absence of any exact knowledge of natural law there
is no reason why a man should not be thought capable of inflicting
sickness and death, bringing rain, securing food, and doing all that
relates to human life. Magicians, prophets, ascetics, and saints are
credited with such powers in early and later times. Polynesian chiefs
are supposed to be imbued with a sacredness that makes contact
with them dangerous, and everything that they touch becomes
thereby taboo to the ordinary man; the same sort of sacredness
clung to the Roman flamen dialis, to the emperor of Japan, and
to many other high officials. This reverence, however, is simply
fear of the mysterious, and does not, in itself, reach the height of
worship, though it prepares the way for it and may sometimes
be scarcely distinguishable from worship proper. The magician is
the mouthpiece of a god, and in popular belief is often invested
with power that is practically divine.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_337" id="p_337">337</a></b>. Many cases, in fact, are reported in which living men are
worshiped as gods; but such reports are often open to doubt and
need confirmation. Travelers and other observers are not always
in position to state the facts precisely; particularly they do not
always distinguish between awe and religious worship, and the
statements of savages on this point are often vague. Frazer has
collected a considerable number of examples of alleged worship of
living men.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> One of these, that of the dairyman (<i>palol</i>) of the
Todas of Southern India, is not supported by the latest observer,
who says that the palol is highly respected but not worshiped.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a>
An apparently clear case of worship is the Panjab god Nikkal
Sen, said to be General Nicholson;<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> and it is not improbable that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>in other cases mentioned by Frazer (Marquesas Islands, Raiatea,
Samoa, Fiji) actual deification takes place.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_338" id="p_338">338</a></b>. Among many more-advanced communities divinity has
been ascribed to living monarchs: to the kings of ancient Egypt;
to many early Babylonian kings; to the emperor of China; to some
of the Ptolemies and Seleucids; to certain Roman emperors; to
the kings of Mexico and Peru; and in more modern times to
the emperor of Japan. Whether such titles involve a real ascription
of divinity, or are only an assertion of kinship with the
gods, or express nothing more than the adulation of courtiers,
it may not be easy always to determine; probably all these conceptions
have existed at various times. The conception that men
are akin to gods, that there is no difference of nature between the
two classes, is an old one, and the ascription of divinity to a king
might involve, in earlier stages of civilization or even in relatively
advanced stages, no break in the order of things. The custom once
established, it might continue to be observed, long accepted seriously
by the mass of the people, but coming gradually to be regarded
by the educated classes as a mere form.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_339" id="p_339">339</a></b>. The development of the custom appears most plainly in
<i>Egypt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> The identification of the king with Horus (apparently the
ancient patron deity of Egypt) runs through the history down to
the Persian conquest: he is called "Horus" or "Golden Horus,"
and sometimes (as, for example, Mentuhotep IV) "heir of Horus,"
or is said to sit on the throne of Horus, and has a "Horus name,"
the affirmation of his divine character; even the monotheistic reformer
Amenhotep IV is called "Golden Horus." At the same
time he is styled the "son" of this or that deity&mdash;Re, Min, Amon,
Amon-Re, Osiris&mdash;according to the particular patron adopted by
him; the liberal interpretation of such filial relation is illustrated
by the title "son of the gods of the Northland" given to one
monarch. The king is "the good god"; at death he flies to
heaven (so, for instance, Totmose III, of the eighteenth dynasty).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_340" id="p_340">340</a></b>. The official honorific character of divine titles appears as
early as the fifteenth century, when Queen Hatshepsut is officially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>declared to be the daughter of Amon. By such an official procedure
Alexander, though not akin to any Egyptian royal house,
was declared to be the son of Amon; Ptolemy Philadelphus became
the son of the sun-god, and his wife Arsino&euml; was made a
goddess by a solemn ceremony. Possibly the recognition of the
divine title, in educated Egyptian circles, as a conventional form
began at a relatively early time&mdash;the easy way in which a man
was made a god may have been felt in such circles to be incompatible
with real divinity. Nevertheless the cult of the divinized
king was practiced seriously. In some cases the living monarch had
his temple and retinue of priests, and divine honors were paid him.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_341" id="p_341">341</a></b>. The case was different in the <i>Semitic treatment of kings</i>
styled divine. The custom of so regarding them is found only in
early Babylonia. The evidence that they were held to be divine
consists in the fact that the determinative for divinity (Sumerian
<i>dingir</i>, Semitic <i>an</i>) is prefixed to their names in the inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a>
It appears that the determinative occurs at times during a period
of about a thousand years (ca. 3000-2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;the chronology
is uncertain), and is then dropped. The data do not explain the
reasons for this change of custom; a natural suggestion is that
there came a time when the conception of the deity forbade an
ascription of divinity to human beings. However this may be,
the nominal divinization of kings seems not to have had any effect
on the cultus. As far as the known evidence goes, the king seems
never to have been approached with divine worship.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_342" id="p_342">342</a></b>. It may be doubted whether the Babylonian usage can
properly be called Semitic. As such a custom is found nowhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>else in the Semitic area, and as the early Babylonian Semites
borrowed much from the non-Semitic Sumerians (they borrowed
their system of writing and some literary material), it is conceivable
that they adopted this practice from them. There is, to be
sure, no proof, except from the inscriptions, that the practice was
Sumerian; but, as it is found in some Asiatic non-Semitic lands,<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a>
there is the possibility that it existed among the Sumerians, of
whose history, however, we unfortunately know little. It is to be
noted that the cessation of the practice appears to be synchronous
with the establishment of the first great Semitic dynasty at Babylon.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_343" id="p_343">343</a></b>. No ascription of divinity to men is found among the
<i>Hebrews</i>. The Elohim-beings (called "sons of God" in the English
translation of the Bible) are gods. The code forbids men to
curse God (not "judges")<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a>&mdash;judges are not called "gods."
There is nothing going to show that the old Hebrew kings were
looked on as divine. Frazer's hypothesis that the king was identified
with the God Adonis<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> is not supported by the statements
of the Old Testament; the title 'my lord' (<i>adoni</i>) given him is
simply the ordinary expression of respect and courtesy. He is
"the anointed of Yahweh," as many ancient official persons (kings
and priests) were inducted into office by the pouring of oil on their
heads, but, as a mouthpiece and representative of the deity, he is inferior
to the prophet; at best, flattery, such as that of the woman of
Tekoa, might liken him to an angel.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> The epithet <i>el gibbor</i> (English
Bible, "mighty God"), applied to a Jewish prince, must probably be
rendered 'mighty hero.'<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> The title 'gods' has been supposed to be
given to men (judges) a couple of times in the Psalter,<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> but the reference
there seems to be to Greek deities regarded as acting as judges.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span><b><a name="p_344" id="p_344">344</a></b>. The ascription of divinity to human beings is lacking in
<i>Arabia</i> also and among Semitic Moslems generally. The Ismailic
and Babist dogmas of the incarnation of God in certain men are
of Aryan (Indian) origin.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_345" id="p_345">345</a></b>. The <i>Chinese</i> conception of the all-pervading and absolute
power of the Universe naturally invests the emperor with divinity.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a>
All human beings are supposed to possess some portion of the
divine essence, but he alone, as head and representative of the
nation, possesses it in full measure. He is theoretically perfect in
thought, word, and deed, and is entitled not only to the reverence
and obedience of his subjects, but also to their religious homage.
Larger acquaintance with other peoples has doubtless led educated
Chinese to regard him as only one among several great kings in
the world, but for the people at large he is still practically a god.
Other living men also are worshiped as divine.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_346" id="p_346">346</a></b>. The <i>Japanese</i> formal divinization of the emperor appears
to have begun with the establishment of the monarchy (in the
sixth or seventh century of our era), but, like the Chinese, goes
back to the crude conception of early times. It has been generally
accepted seriously by the people, but has not received philosophical
formulation. It is now practically given up by the
educated classes, and will probably soon vanish completely.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_347" id="p_347">347</a></b>. Among the <i>Greeks</i> and the <i>Romans</i> the belief in the divinity
of living men and women was of a vague character. In Homer
the epithet <i>dios</i> when applied to human beings (individuals or
peoples) means little more, if any more, than 'of exalted character'
(except in the case of mythical heroes, like Achilles, who
were of actual divine parentage). At a later time such divinization
was sometimes treated jestingly. If Plutarch may be accepted
as authority,<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> Alexander did not take his own godhead seriously,
did not believe in it, but allowed it merely for its effect on others.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>It was little more than a farce when the Syrian-Greek Antiochus II,
for services rendered to a city, was called "Theos" by the grateful
citizens;<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> it was the baldest flattery when Herod's oration<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a>
was greeted by a tumultuous assembly as the "voice of a god."
Augustus, though he allowed temples and altars to be consecrated
to him in the provinces, did not permit it in Rome, being, apparently,
ashamed of such procedures.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> The most infamous of the
early emperors, Caligula, received divine honors in his lifetime by
his own decree.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> Apart from these particular cases, however, the
general conception of the possibility of a man's being divine had a
notable effect on the religious development in the Roman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a>
The custom, for example, of burning incense before the Emperor's
statue (which faithful Christians refused to do), while it strengthened
the idea of the presence of the divine in human life, doubtless
debased it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_348" id="p_348">348</a></b>. Deification of living men is not found in the great national
religions of <i>India</i> and <i>Persia</i>. Mazdaism, like Hebraism, kept the
human distinctly apart from the divine: Ahura Mazda is virtually
absolute, and Zoroaster and the succeeding prophets, including the
savior &Ccedil;aoshyan&ccedil;, are men chosen and appointed by him.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> Vedism
developed the nature-gods, and in Brahmanism the goal of the
worshiper was union with the divine, but not independent divinity;
the muni by ascetic observances might attain a power equal or
superior to that of the gods and feared by them,<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> but he remained
(like the old magician) a powerful man and did not receive divine
worship.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> In recent times the followers of the Brahma-Samaj leader
Sen are said to have worshiped him as a god<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a>&mdash;apparently an
isolated phenomenon, the origin of which is not clear. Buddha was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>purely human to himself and his contemporaries. The ascription of
divinity to the Tibetan Grand Lamas is a product of the transformation
of Buddhism under the influence of a crude non-Aryan population
that retained the old conception of the essential identity of
nature of men and gods.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_349" id="p_349">349</a></b>. When chiefs and kings are divinized, offerings are usually
made to them as to other gods; their cult becomes a part of the
polytheistic system. But it is rare that they displace the old local
deities or equal them in influence. Their worship passes with the
passing of polytheism.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Cult of the Dead</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_350" id="p_350">350</a></b>. In the history of religion the veneration of the dead, as is
remarked above, is more widely diffused and more effective than
that of the living. We may distinguish between the cult of known
historical persons after death (which is closely related to that of
living men), the deification of mythical ancestors, and the worship
of ghosts.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_351" id="p_351">351</a></b>. <i>Historical persons.</i> In simple communities commanding
personalities that have impressed the imagination of the people by
proofs of power and by conferring benefits on communities may
not unnaturally receive divine honors after death. Lyall reports a
case of this sort in recent times: the French officer Raymond in
Hyderabad is said to have been worshiped as a god.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> Other cases
are reported as occuring in Samoa and in India.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> Rivers mentions
traditions among the Todas of Southern India which, he thinks,
may vouch for the worship of gods who were originally men, but
implicit reliance cannot be placed on such traditions.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> Two apparently
definite instances of deification are given by Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> both of
cruel kings (one dethroned in 1818), to whom temples with complete
rituals are dedicated; but the deification in one of these cases
(and probably in the other) was a deliberate act of political leaders,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>and not a product of spontaneous popular feeling. Two other local
gods mentioned by Ellis were, according to the tradition, two men
who began the trade that made Whydah the chief port of the
west coast of Africa; but here also the tradition is not perfectly
trustworthy.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_352" id="p_352">352</a></b>. Egyptian kings were regularly deified after death, being
identified with Osiris; their cult, though not equal in sanctity to
that of the gods proper, was still prominent and important.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> It is
probably to be regarded as a revision and magnification of the cult
of the dead kin, combined with the desire to honor great representative
men. No such custom is known to have existed among
Semitic peoples, by whom a sharp distinction was made between
the divine and the human. In India it was chiefly the ascetic sages
that were religiously eminent, and in the prevailing pantheistic
system these (as is remarked above), absorbing the divine essence,
sometimes became as powerful as gods, but passed after death into
the cosmic All, and remained human. The Mazdean faith, like the
Israelite, made it impossible to accept a deceased man as a god.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_353" id="p_353">353</a></b>. Examples of the occasional divinization of deceased men
in the Hellenic world are given below.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> In Rome the custom arose
at a comparatively late period, and it was the work not of spontaneous
Roman thought but of political philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> The deification
of the Roman emperors after death had its ground in the
reconstruction of Roman life undertaken by Augustus. He recognized
a principle of unification in the resuscitation of the old national
religion, in which the people believed, whether he himself did or
not. Religion in Rome was largely an affair of the state; the
leaders of the public religion were great state officials. Augustus
was made pontifex maximus, and it was only one step farther to
elevate the chief magistrate to the rank of a god. The good sense
of the time generally forbade the bestowment of this honor during
the imperator's lifetime, but an apotheosis was in accord with the
veneration paid to the manes and with the exalted position of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>Emperor as absolute lord of the Western world.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> Popular feeling
appears to have accepted this divinization without question and in
sincerity; educated circles accepted it as an act of political policy.
The elevation of Julius C&aelig;sar and Augustus to the rank of gods
established the rule, and deceased emperors received divine honors
up to the triumph of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_354" id="p_354">354</a></b>. In China, Confucius was deified as the special exponent of
the state religion and the authoritative teacher of the principles of
social and political life. His religious cult is practiced by the government
(officially) and by the masses of the people; how far it is
sincerely accepted by the educated classes is uncertain. In China
and in Japan the gods of war are said to be historical persons deified.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_355" id="p_355">355</a></b>. The divinization of the Calif Ali by some Shiah sects was
the product of religious fanaticism under the guidance of Aryan
conceptions of the incarnation of the divine.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_356" id="p_356">356</a></b>. <i>Mythical ancestors.</i> Mythical ancestors are usually eponymous;
the tendency in all ancient peoples was to refer their names
and origins to single persons. Such an eponym was the product of
imagination, a genealogical myth (Hellen, Ion, Dorus, Jacob, Israel),
and was revered, but was not always the object of a religious cult;
such cults do not appear among the Semites<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> or in the native
Roman rites. Nor does the custom seem to have originated in the
earliest periods; it was rather a creation of quasi-scientific reflection,
the demand for definite historical organization, and it appears
first in relatively late literary monuments.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_357" id="p_357">357</a></b>. Still later arose the worship of these ancestral founders.
In Greece shrines were erected by various cities to their supposed
founders, and where, as in Athens, the tribes had their eponyms,
these received divine worship, though they never attained equal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>rank with the gods proper. From Greece this cult was brought into
Italy. It was probably under Greek influence, and at a relatively
late time, that Romulus was created, made the immediate founder
of Rome, and took his place among the objects of worship;<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> on the
other hand, &AElig;neas (a Greek importation), though he was accepted
as original founder, never received divine worship, doubtless because
Romulus (nearer in name to the city Roma) already held the position
of divine patron. The cult of eponyms tended naturally to coalesce
with that of divine 'heroes'<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a>&mdash;the two figures were alike in character,
differing mainly in function, and eponyms were styled 'heroes.'<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_358" id="p_358">358</a></b>. The inverse process, the reduction of divine beings to
simple human proportions, has gone on in early cults and in
early attempts at historical construction to a not inconsiderable
degree. Thus, to take a relatively late example, by Saxo Grammaticus
and in the Heimskringla (both of the thirteenth century)
the god Odin is made into a human king and the history of his
exploits is given in detail.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> It is, however, especially in the treatment
of the old divine heroes, originally true gods, that the process
of dedivinization appears. These figures, because of their local
character and for other reasons, entered into peculiarly close relations
with human societies, of which they thus tended to become
constituent parts, and the same feeling that gave the gods human
shapes converted the heroes into mere men, who are generally
reconstructers of society. Examples of this sort of anthropomorphizing
are found in myths all over the world: the Babylonian
Gilgamesh; the "mighty men" of Genesis vi, 4, originally demigods,
the progeny of human mothers and of the Elohim-beings
(the Ben&euml; Elohim, 'sons of the gods,' members, that is, of the divine
circle); Heracles and Hercules; the Scandinavian (apparently
general Teutonic) Valkyrs, Nornas, and Swan-maidens.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span><b><a name="p_359" id="p_359">359</a></b>. The Sicilian Euhemeros (of the latter part of the fourth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), after extensive travels to great places of worship,
formulated the theory that all the gods were deified men. Some
grounds for his theory he doubtless had, for, according to ancient
opinion, gods might and did die, and their places of burial were
sometimes pointed out (the grave of Zeus, for instance, in Crete).
How far this view had been held before the time of Euhemeros is
uncertain, but he gave it vogue, and it is called, after him, Euhemerism.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a>
In recent times it has been revived in part by Herbert
Spencer and Allen, who derive all gods from ghosts.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> Similar to
it is the rationalizing of myths, which has met with favor at various
times.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_360" id="p_360">360</a></b>. <i>The dead kin.</i> Apart from the special cases mentioned
above, the dead have been the objects of particular care in all
parts of the world. Some of the observances connected with them
might perhaps, in themselves considered, be ascribed to natural
affection. It cannot be denied that savages have some love of
kindred, and this feeling, in conjunction with the ideas concerning
the future state, might lead the survivors to do such things
as it was believed would secure the comfort of the deceased&mdash;decent
burial in accordance with tribal customs, and provision of
food and attendants and other necessaries. But, while the existence
and influence of natural human kindliness need not be denied,
observation of savage life favors the conclusion that the greater
part of the early usages connected with the dead have their origin
in the desire to conciliate them, to avert their displeasure and gain
their aid, and thus come to constitute a cult of the dead that runs
through all phases of civilization.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_361" id="p_361">361</a></b>. Such usages must be very ancient, for they are found in
the lowest tribes, and appear to be based on the earliest known
conceptions of the nature of departed souls.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> These latter are held
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>to have all the ordinary affections of the living, but to be endowed
with extraordinary powers: they have their likes and dislikes, their
kindliness, jealousy, anger, revengefulness, all on the lower moral
grade of undeveloped life; they are, in many regards, not subject
to the ordinary limitations of the living&mdash;they are invisible, move
swiftly from place to place through obstacles impervious to the
living, enter their bodies, produce sickness and death, aid or destroy
crops. On the other hand, they need food and other necessities
of ordinary life, and for these things are dependent on the living.
Hence the desirableness of securing their good will by showing them
respect and supplying their needs, or else of somehow getting rid
of them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_362" id="p_362">362</a></b>. There are, then, two sorts of ghosts, or, more precisely,
two sorts of ghostly activity&mdash;the friendly and the unfriendly&mdash;and
corresponding to these are the emotions of love and fear which
they call forth. On account of paucity of data it is difficult to say
which of these emotions is the commoner among savages; probably
the feeling is a mixed one, compounded of fear and friendliness.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a>
In general it is evident that with the better organization of family
life a gentler feeling for the dead was called forth; but it is probable
that in the least-developed communities fear of the mysterious
departed was the prevailing emotion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_363" id="p_363">363</a></b>. Though the accessible evidence does not enable us to determine
with certainty the motives of all savage customs connected
with the dead, there are some distinctions that may be made with
fair probability. To supply the dead with food and cooking-utensils
may very well be, as is remarked above, the impulse of affection,
and even where slaves and wives are slain that their ghosts may
minister to the ghost of the master and husband, this may not go
beyond pious solicitude for the comfort of the deceased. But the
mourning-usages common with savages are too violent to be
merely the expression of love; the loud cries and the wounding of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>the person are meant more probably to assure the deceased of the
high regard in which he is held;<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> in some cases, as among the
Central Australians, men gash themselves so severely as to come
near producing death.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> These excessive demonstrations are softened
as general culture increases, and finally dwindle to an apparatus of
hired mourners. A similar explanation holds of the restriction of
food, the seclusion of the widow or the widower, and the rule against
mentioning the name of the deceased: abstinence and silence are
marks of respect.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_364" id="p_364">364</a></b>. Funeral feasts also testify respect:<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> they appear to be
extensions of the practice of providing food for the dead, feasts
in which the mourners, from motives of thriftiness, take part;
the ghost consumes only the invisible soul of the food, and it is
proper that what is left should furnish refreshment for the living.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a>
The funeral festivities are sometimes protracted, and become occasions
of enjoyment to the circle of kinsfolk, in some cases at a
ruinous expense to the family of the deceased, as is true now sometimes
of Irish and other wakes. The honor of the family is involved,
and this fact, together with the natural desire for pleasure, has contributed
to the development of the custom in savage as well as in
civilized life. In general the solemnity of the various ceremonies
and other usages testifies to a profound conviction of the necessity
of keeping on good terms with the dead.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_365" id="p_365">365</a></b>. The reports of savage customs show a certain number of
cases in which the benevolent and the malevolent activities of the
dead are equally prominent: so, for example, among the Australian
Kurnai,<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> the New Zealanders,<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> the Melanesian peoples,<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>Vezimbas of Madagascar,<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> the Zulus,<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> the E&#7811;e-speaking tribes on the
west coast of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> It is probable that the list might be greatly
extended by exact observation. When we find two peoples, dwelling
near together and of the same grade of general culture, credited
the one with fear, the other with friendly feeling toward the dead,
it seems likely that different sets of usages have met the eyes of
the observers; a certain amount of accident must color such reports.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_366" id="p_366">366</a></b>. It is natural to suppose that fear of ghosts is commoner
among less-developed peoples, kindly feeling more usual in higher
communities; and when civilized peoples are taken into account
this sort of progression is obvious. But the reports of savages
show such a mixture of customs that it is difficult to see any line
of progress. Dread of ghosts is certified in Central Australia and
North Queensland, in Tonga (Polynesia), Central Africa, Central
Asia, among the North American Chippewas, Navahos, and Southwest
Oregon Indians, and the South American Araucanians; friendly
feeling is found in Tasmania, Western Africa, South Africa, California,
and among the Iroquois and the Zu&ntilde;i Indians.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> In such
lists there is no clear sign of a division according to general culture.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_367" id="p_367">367</a></b>. Friendly relations with the dead do not in themselves necessarily
involve worship, but a more or less definite <i>cult of ghosts</i> is
found in various parts of the world. They are, or were, regarded as
tutelary spirits in Tasmania, Ashanti, and Dahomi (where shrines
are dedicated to them), and by the Zu&ntilde;i Indians; prayers are addressed
to them in Samoa and the Hawaiian Islands (where there
is a definite family worship), in Yoruba, by the Banyas and the
Zulus, by the Ossetes, the Veddahs of Ceylon, and the North
American Dakotas; offerings are made to them&mdash;sometimes to
influential persons, chiefs, and others, as in the Gilbert Islands, in
parts of Melanesia, in Borneo, and by the Cakchiquels of Central
America&mdash;sometimes to all the dead, as in the Solomon Islands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>the New Hebrides, Fiji, Torres Straits, and by the Zulus, the Veddahs
of Ceylon, the Kolarians of Bengal, and the Ossetes.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_368" id="p_368">368</a></b>. These lists include peoples of very different grades of culture;
the inference suggested is that the cult of the dead is of
very early origin&mdash;its basis is the same among all communities
that practice it, though the particular ceremonies of worship vary.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_369" id="p_369">369</a></b>. Besides forms of actual worship there are several usages
that involve religious veneration of the dead. Graves are regarded
as asylums by the Kafirs (graves of chiefs)<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> and in Tonga.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> The
Bedawin of Arabia held (in pre-Islamic times), and still hold, graves
sacred;<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> they sometimes become shrines, and oaths are sworn by
them. The custom of swearing by the dead is widespread. In their
character of powerful spirits they are agents in processes of magic
and divination. Parts of dead bodies are used as charms. The
skull especially is revered as an oracle.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_370" id="p_370">370</a></b>. Among the lower tribes, savage and half-civilized, it is
chiefly those who have died recently that are worshiped. A Zulu
explained to Callaway that his people forgot those who died long
ago&mdash;they were supposed to be not helpful&mdash;and hope of gain
has always been the basis of worship. Among the Kafirs of the
Hindu Kush it is the custom to erect an effigy to the memory of
every adult one year after his decease. Women, as well as men,
are thus honored, and may be put on an equality with men by
being given a throne to sit on. No worship is offered to these
images, but it is believed that their presence brings prosperity;
bad weather is ascribed to their removal. There are solemn dances
in honor of the illustrious dead and sacrifices are offered to them.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_371" id="p_371">371</a></b>. The worship of the dead in the great civilized communities,
though more elaborate and refined than the savage cult, is in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>substance identical with it. The Egyptians provided the departed
soul with food and honored the dead man with laudatory notices of
his earthly life; the royal ancestor of a king, it was believed, might
act as mediator between him and the gods.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> The Babylonians,
while they lamented the departure of men to the gloomy existence
in the Underworld, recognized the quasi-divine power of the
dead and addressed prayer to them.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> The Hebrews offered food
to the dead, had funeral feasts, and consulted ghosts who were
regarded as divine.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> The Hindu "fathers," though kept distinct
from the gods, were yet conceived of as possessing godlike powers
and were worshiped as gods.<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> The Persian "forefathers" (<i>fravashis</i>),
particularly the manes of eminent pious men, were held to
be bestowers of all the blessings of life; offerings were made and
prayers addressed to them.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_372" id="p_372">372</a></b>. Early notices of a cult of the dead among the Greeks are
scanty. There was the usual kindly provision of food, arms, and
other necessaries for them.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> Odysseus in Hades pours out a libation
(honey, wine, water, to which meal is added) to all the dead,
addresses vows and prayers to them, and promises to offer to them
a barren heifer on his return to Ithaca, and a black sheep separately
to Teiresias.<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> From the sixth century onward the references in the
literature show that the worship of the dead (including children)
was then general (and of course it must have begun much earlier).
The offerings made to them were both vegetable and animal; the
sacrificed animal was slaughtered in the same way as in the sacrifices
to chthonic deities&mdash;the dead were, in fact, regarded as
underground deities.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> The flesh of the animals offered was not
eaten by the worshipers.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_373" id="p_373">373</a></b>. Among the dead thus honored is to be included one class
of heroes. A Greek "hero" was sometimes an eminent man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>sometimes such a man divinized, sometimes an old god reduced to
human dimensions, reckoned in some cases to belong to the circle
of the gods proper.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> Such personages might be worshiped as gods,
with the sacrifices appropriate to the gods, or as departed men,
with the sacrifices that custom fixed for the dead. The hero-cult
included many men of note recently deceased, like Brasidas and
those that fell at Marathon.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_374" id="p_374">374</a></b>. The cults just mentioned dealt with the departed as friendly
souls, the protectors of the family, the clan, or the state. The state
cult of the dead was elaborate and solemn. The Greek citizen was
surrounded by a host of the eminent dead who kept him in touch
with the past and offered him ideals of life.<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> Another attitude
toward the dead is indicated by the great apotropaic spring festival,
the Anthesteria of Athens, the object of which was to rid the city
of the ghosts that then wandered about.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> This double attitude is
precisely that of the savage tribes referred to above. The same
difference of feeling appears in the Roman cults: the <i>manes</i> are
the friendly or doubtful souls of dead ancestors; the Parentalia is
a festival in honor of the dead kin; in the Lemuria, on the other
hand, the father of the family performs a ceremony at midnight
intended to rid the house of ghosts.<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_375" id="p_375">375</a></b>. Among modern peoples it is the Chinese that have organized
the worship of the dead in the completest way; it is for them
the most important part of the popular religion.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> Similar veneration
of ancestors exists in Japan.<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span><b><a name="p_376" id="p_376">376</a></b>. The venerated dead stood apart, as a rule, from the nature-spirits
and the gods, but these different classes sometimes coalesced,
as has been remarked above, in popular usage. The powers and
functions of the dead were not essentially different from those of
the divinities proper, particularly in the simpler stages of society.
They were able to bestow all the blessings and to inflict all the
misfortunes of life. In process of time the advance of knowledge
relegated them to a subordinate place, but they long retained a
considerable importance as friends of families and states, as disseminators
of disease, and as predictors of human fortunes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_377" id="p_377">377</a></b>. In the exercise of these functions they were often not to
be distinguished from the higher and lower deities. King Saul, on
the eve of a great battle, having failed to get an answer from the
national deity by the ordinary legitimate methods, had recourse to
necromancy and obtained from the ghost of Samuel the information
that Yahweh had refused to give.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> The Greek <i>k&#275;res</i> and the
wandering ghosts of West Africa do exactly what is ascribed to
the malefic spirits of Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> Examples of such identity of
function between the various superhuman Powers are found all
over the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_378" id="p_378">378</a></b>. This fact does not show that these Powers have the same
origin. The savage accepts agents in human life wherever he can
find them&mdash;in beings inhabiting mountains, rocks, trees, caves,
springs, and in the souls of departed men. Doubtless he thinks
of the forms of these various actors as being all of the same sort, a
sublimated manlike body; but he keeps them in different categories,
and in the course of time the tendency is for ghosts and spirits to
sink out of sight and for the gods to absorb all extrahuman activities.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_379" id="p_379">379</a></b>. The ethical power of the cults so far discussed resides in
the human association to which they give rise and the sanctions they
supply to conduct. Of these two effects the former is the more
important. The moral character of a ghost or spirit or deity never
rises above that of its circle of worshipers: its approval or disapproval
is the echo of current usage, and has special efficiency only
in the accompanying power of reward or punishment; it appeals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>to the hopes and fears of men. This police function is doubtless
valuable in restraining from crime and inciting to good conduct, but
it has no regenerative power. The enlargement of human association,
on the other hand, increases sympathy and co&ouml;peration among
men, and paves the way to the cultivation of the mutual respect and
regard which is the basis of social virtue.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_380" id="p_380">380</a></b>. Among the lower cults ancestor-worship may be expected
to take the highest place, for the reason that it tends to strengthen
family unity and the solidarity of the clan, tribe, or nation; all such
knitting together of men makes for the increase of honesty and
kindliness. The data are lacking, however, for the determination
of this point. It may be said in general that the attitude toward
the dead becomes finer with advance in civilization; but before a
specific moral power in ancestor-worship can be proved, it will be
necessary to have exact details of moral ideas and conduct in all
the lower tribes, together with some information regarding the attitude
of individuals toward questions of conduct, and the motives
that impel toward this or that action. The question of ethical
growth in society is a complicated one, and the most that can
be said for any element of social constitution is that it tends to
strengthen or weaken the individual's confidence in and regard
for his fellows.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_381" id="p_381">381</a></b>. The part played in religious history by the worship of the
dead is so important that some writers have derived all religion
from it.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> This view is now generally rejected for the reason that it
does not accord with known facts; it is only by forced (though often
ingenious) interpretations that a plausible case is made out for it.
To reply in detail to the arguments advanced in its favor would be
to go over the whole ground of the origin of religious observances;
the answer is furnished by setting forth the nature of the various
cults, as is attempted in this and following chapters. If, for example,
there is reason to believe that savages have always regarded the
lower animals as powerful beings, there is no need, in accounting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>for the veneration given them, to resort to the roundabout way of
assuming a misinterpretation of names of men derived from beasts.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_382" id="p_382">382</a></b>. Between Euhemerism and the theory that explains myths
as a "disease of language" there is little or no essential difference
of principle. Both theories assume that man, having devised certain
epithets, later came to misunderstand them and to build up
histories on the misunderstanding. Both thus rest the immense
mass of human religious customs and beliefs, which form so large
a part of human history, on the precarious foundation of passing
fancy and inadvertence, and they must be put into the same category
with the na&iuml;ve theory, once popular, that religion is the invention
of priests who sought to control men through their fears.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_383" id="p_383">383</a></b>. Ancestor-worship is the feeling of kinship with the dead,
invested by religion with peculiar intensity and solemnity. It has
been one of the great constructive forces of society.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Cults of Generative Powers</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_384" id="p_384">384</a></b>. The origin of religion is not to be referred exclusively to
any one order of ideas; it springs out of man's total life. All
objects and processes have been included in men's construction of
nature, and the processes, when they have been held to bear on
human well-being, have been ascribed to a force inherent in things
or to the activity of supernatural beings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_385" id="p_385">385</a></b>. The study of processes has gone hand in hand with the
creation of divine beings who are supposed to manifest themselves
in the processes. The great spectacle of nature's productivity has
been especially recognizable in the vegetable world and in the world
of man; in both of these life has been perpetually unfolding itself
under men's eyes as a mysterious process, which, by virtue of its
mysteriousness, has become religious material and has entered into
systems of religious worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_386" id="p_386">386</a></b>. The relation of vegetable life to religious cults is referred
to elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> and a brief survey may now be given of usages and
ideas that have been connected with the production of human life.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_387" id="p_387">387</a></b>. It is obvious that not all customs that include the function
of generation are of the nature of religious observances. The
promiscuity that obtains in many savage communities before marriage
is a na&iuml;ve unreflective animal procedure. Exchange of wives
(as in Central Australia) and the offering of a wife to a guest are
matters of social etiquette. Festivals in which sexual license is the
rule are generally merely the expression of natural impulses. Holidays,
being times of amusement, are occasions used by the people
for the satisfaction of all appetites: there is eating and drinking,
buffoonery, disregard of current conventions, unbounded liberty to
do whatever exuberant animalism prompts. Such festivities abound
among existing savages,<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> were not uncommon in ancient civilized
times,<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> and have survived in diminished form to the present day.<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a>
In the course of time they often become attached to the worship of
gods, are organized, explained by myths, and sanctified. In such
cases of coalescence we must distinguish between the true worship
offered to a divine being, and the observances, generally originating
in desire for animal amusement and enjoyment, that have
been attached to them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_388" id="p_388">388</a></b>. <i>Cult of generative organs.</i> Men's attention must have been
directed very early to those organs that were believed to be connected
with the genesis of human life. At what stage this belief
arose it is hardly possible to say; there are peoples among whom
it seems not to exist;<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> but it is found over a great part of the
world, and was doubtless an outcome of popular observation.<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a>
As it was intimately connected with life it passed naturally into
the domain of religion, and in process of time became a more or
less prominent part of religious observances; the organs in question,
both male and female, became objects of religious devotion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_389" id="p_389">389</a></b>. Here again it must be noted that not all usages connected
with the organs of generation were religious of origin. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>is pointed out above<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> that the origin of circumcision and excision
is to be sought in another direction. Ithyphallic images are sometimes
merely attempts at realism in art; a nude figure (as in
modern art) must be represented in its full proportions. Such
seems to be the nature of certain images among the Western
Bantu,<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> and this may have been the case with the images of the
Egyptian Khem and Osiris and similar deities. In general this sort
of representation in savage and ancient civilized communities is
often either simple realism or indecency. Folk-stories abound in
details that sound indecent to modern ears, but were for the authors
often merely copies of current usages.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_390" id="p_390">390</a></b>. All important members of the human body have been
regarded as to a greater or less extent sacred, their importance
depending on their subservience to man's needs. The head of an
enemy gives the slayer wisdom and strength; an oath sworn by
the head or beard of one's father is peculiarly binding; the heart,
when eaten, imparts power; a solemn oath may be sworn by the
sexual organs. In no case does the sacredness of an object necessarily
involve its worship; whether or not it shall receive a true
cult depends on general social considerations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_391" id="p_391">391</a></b>. Though phallic cults proper cannot be shown to be universal
among men, they have played a not inconsiderable part in
religious history. They appear to have passed through the usual
grades of development&mdash;simple at first, later more complicated.
The attitude of savages and low communities generally, non-Christian
and Christian, toward the phallus, suggests that in the earliest
stage of the cult some sort of worship was paid the physical object
itself considered as a creator of life; satisfactory data on this point,
however, are lacking. It was at so early a period that it was
brought into cultic connection with supernatural beings that its
initial forms escape us.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_392" id="p_392">392</a></b>. It seems not to exist now among the lowest peoples.
There are no definite traces of it in the tribes of Oceania, Central
Africa, Central Asia, and America. The silence of explorers
on this point cannot indeed be taken as proof positive of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>nonexistence; yet the absence of distinct mention of it in a great
number of carefully prepared works leads us to infer that it does
not play an important part in the religious systems therein described.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a>
It seems to require, for its establishment, a fairly well-developed
social and political organization. Some of the tribes
named above have departmental deities, mostly of a simple sort,
but apparently it has not occurred to them to isolate this particular
function, which they probably regarded as a familiar part of the
order of things and not needing special mention. The gift of
children was in the hands of the local god, a generally recognized
part of his duty as patron of the tribe, and all sexual matters naturally
might be referred to him. Also, as is remarked above, in
certain tribes there was no knowledge of the connection between
the birth of children and the union of the sexes,<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> and such tribes
would of course ascribe no creative power to the phallus.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_393" id="p_393">393</a></b>. The best example of a half-civilized phallic cult is that
which is now practiced in Yoruba and Dahomi, countries with
definite government and institutions. The cult is attached to the
worship of a deity (Elegba or Legba), who appears to be a patron
of fertility; the phallus occupies a prominent place on his temples,
and its worship is accompanied by the usual licentious rites.<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a>
These are expressions of popular appetite, and it does not appear
that the cult itself is otherwise religiously significant.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_394" id="p_394">394</a></b>. In modern India the &Ccedil;ivaite phallicism is pronounced and
important. The linga is treated as a divine power, and, as producer
of fertility, is especially the object of devotion of women;<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a>
though &Ccedil;ivaism has its rites of unbridled bestialism, the worship of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>the linga by women is often free from impurity; it is practically
worship of a deity of fertility. The origin of the Indian cult is not
clear. As it does not appear in the earliest literature, it has been
supposed to have come into Aryan worship from non-Aryan tribes.
Whatever its origin, it is now widely observed in Aryan India, and
has been adopted by various outlying tribes.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_395" id="p_395">395</a></b>. While it is, or was, well established in Japan, it apparently
has had no marked influence on the religious thought of the people.
Phallic forms abound<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> in the land, in spite of repressive measures
on the part of the government, but the cult partakes of the general
looseness of the Shinto organization of supernatural Powers.
It is said to have been adopted in some cases by Buddhists. It
appears to have been combined with Shinto at a very early (half-civilized)
time, for which, however, no records exist.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_396" id="p_396">396</a></b>. It is among the great ancient civilized peoples that the
most definite organization of phallic cults is found.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_397" id="p_397">397</a></b>. For Egypt there is the testimony of Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> who
describes a procession of women bearing small phallic images and
singing hymns in honor of a deity whom he calls Dionysos&mdash;probably
Khem or Osiris or Bes; such images are mentioned by
Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> supposed by him to represent Osiris. Both Khem and
Osiris were great gods, credited with general creative power, and
popular ceremonies of a phallicistic nature might easily be attached
to their cults. Bes, a less important deity, seems to have been
fashioned largely by popular fancy. These ceremonies were doubtless
attended with license,<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> but they probably formed no part of
Egyptian serious worship. The phallus was essential in a realistic
image, but it appears to have been regarded simply as a physical
part of the god or as an emblem of him; there is no evidence
that worship was addressed to it in itself.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_398" id="p_398">398</a></b>. The evidence that has been adduced for a cult of the phallus
among Semitic peoples is of a doubtful nature. No ithyphallic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>images or figures of gods have been found. Religious prostitution
there was in all North Semitic lands,<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> but this is a wholly different
thing from a phallicistic cult. It is supposed, however, by not a few
scholars that descriptions and representations of the phallus occur
in so many places as to make some sort of cult of the object probable.
In a passage of the Book of Isaiah, descriptive of a foreign
cult practiced, probably, by some Jews, the phallus, it is held, is
named.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> The passage is obscure. The nature and origin of the cult
referred to are not clear; it is not elsewhere mentioned. The word
(<i>yad</i>, usually 'hand') supposed to mean 'phallus' is not found
in this sense elsewhere in the Old Testament or in later Hebrew
literature. But, if the proposed rendering be adopted, the reference
will be not to a cult of the phallus but to sexual intercourse,
a figurative description of idolatry.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_399" id="p_399">399</a></b>. A distinct mention of phalli as connected with religious
worship occurs in Pseudo-Lucian's description of the temple of a
certain goddess at Hierapolis.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> He gives the name to enormously
high structures standing in the propyl&aelig;a of the temple, but mentions
no details suggesting a phallic cult. Twice a year, he says,
a man ascends one of them, on the top of which he stays seven
days, praying, as some think, for a blessing on all Syria&mdash;a procedure
suggesting that the pillar was simply a structure consecrated
to the deity of the place (probably Atargatis, who is often called "the
Syrian goddess")<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a>. However, if there was a phallic cult there (the
phallus being regarded as a symbol of the productive function of
the deity), it is not certain that it was Semitic. Hierapolis had long
been an important religious center in a region in which Asiatic and
Greek worships were influential, and foreign elements might easily
have become attached to the worship of a Semitic deity. The cult
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>of the Asian Great Mother (whom the Greeks identified with their
Leto) had orgiastic elements. Lucian's reference to a custom of
emasculation suggests Asian features at Hierapolis.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_400" id="p_400">400</a></b>. In Babylonia and Palestine stones, held by some to be
phalli, have been found.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> While the shape of some of these objects
and their occurrence at shrines may be supposed to lend support
to this view, its correctness is open to doubt. There is no documentary
evidence as to the character of the objects in question,
and they may be explained otherwise than as phalli. But, if they
are phalli, their presence does not prove a phallic cult&mdash;they may
be votive objects, indicating that the phallus was regarded as in
some sort sacred, not that it was worshiped. Decision of the
question may be reserved till more material has been collected.
There is no sufficient ground for regarding the stone posts that
stood by Hebrew shrines as phallic symbols; they are naturally
explained as sacred stones, originally embodying a deity, later
attached to his shrines as traditional objects entitled to veneration.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_401" id="p_401">401</a></b>. In Asia Minor and the Hellenic communities (both in
Ionia and in Greece proper) the phallicistic material is extensive
and complicated. A symbolic signification appears to have been
superimposed on early realistic anthropomorphic figures that were
simply images of supernatural Powers. In various regions such
figures came to be associated with the generative force of nature
in human birth, and the tendency to specialization assigned these
divine beings special functions; of this nature, probably, were the
local Athenian deities Orthanes, Konisalos, and others.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> At a later
period such functions were attributed to the well-developed gods
of fertility; rituals sprang up and were explained by myths, and
various combinations and identifications were made between the
prominent gods.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span><b><a name="p_402" id="p_402">402</a></b>. The most interesting figure of this character is Priapos,
an ithyphallic deity of uncertain origin; his special connection
was with Lampsakos, and he may have been an Asian creation.
From the variety of his functions (he was patron of gardens and
viticulture, of sailors and fishermen, and in some places a god of
war)<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> it may be surmised that he was originally a local deity, charged
with the care of all human interests, in an agricultural community
the patron of fertility, and at some time, and under circumstances
unknown to us, especially connected with sexual life. Whatever
his origin, his cult spread over Greece, he was identified with certain
Greek deities, licentious popular festivals naturally attached
themselves to his worship, and his name became a synonym of sexual
passion. In the later time the pictorial representations of him
became grossly indecent; his cult was an outlet for popular and
artistic license.<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> On the other hand, in the higher thought he was
made the representative of the production of universal animal life,
and rose to the rank of a great god.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_403" id="p_403">403</a></b>. The Greek deities with whom Priapos was oftenest identified
were Dionysos and Hermes&mdash;both gods of fertility. They,
as great gods of such a nature, would naturally absorb lesser phallicistic
figures; but they were specialized in other directions, and
Priapos remained as the distinctest embodiment of phallicistic conceptions.
Other such figures, as Pan, Titans, Sileni, and Satyrs,
were beings connected with fields, woods, and mountains, products
of a low form of civilization, to whom realistic forms and licentious
festivals naturally attached themselves.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_404" id="p_404">404</a></b>. Rome had its native ithyphallic deity, Mutunus Tutunus (or
Mutinus), a na&iuml;ve symbol of generative power.<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> Little is known of
his cult beyond the fact that he figured in marriage ceremonies
in a peculiarly indecent way; by later writers he is sometimes identified
with Priapos.<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> The Romans adopted the cult of Priapos as
well as other phallicistic forms of worship; his original character
appears in his r&ocirc;le of patron of gardens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span><b><a name="p_405" id="p_405">405</a></b>. Phalli as amulets occur in all parts of the world; as symbols
and perhaps as abodes of deities, they have been held potent
to ward off all evils.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_406" id="p_406">406</a></b>. The female organ (<i>yoni</i>, <i>kteis</i>) appears frequently in figures
of female deities, ordinarily without special significance, religious or
other, except as a sign of sex. In the rare cases in which it is the
object of religious veneration (as in India) it is subordinated to the
phallos<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a>&mdash;there is little or no evidence for the existence of a yonistic
cult proper.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> Female deities act as fully formed anthropomorphic
Powers, embodiments of the productive energies of nature; they
are generally treated as persons, without special reference to bodily
parts. The most definite formulation of this conception appears
in &Ccedil;aktism, the worship of the female principle in nature as represented
by various goddesses, often accompanied, naturally, by
licentious rites.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_407" id="p_407">407</a></b>. <i>Androgynous deities</i> represent attempts to combine in a
single person the two sides of the productive power of nature.
Such attempts are relatively late, implying a considerable degree of
reflection and organization; how early they began we have not the
data to determine. They are not found among savage or half-civilized
peoples.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_408" id="p_408">408</a></b>. In Semitic lands no artistic representations of a bisexual
deity are now known, but evidence is adduced to show that this
conception existed in early times. It has been sought in two old
Babylonian inscriptions published by the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> The
first of these (written in Sumerian) reads: "For [or, in honor of]
the (divine) king of countries, the (divine) Nana [Ishtar], the lady
Nana, Lugaltarsi, king of Kish, has constructed," etc. Barton takes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>the two titles "the divine Ishtar" (='king of countries,' masculine)
and "the lady Ishtar" to refer to the same deity, in whose
person would thus be united male and female beings. If, however,
the king of countries and Ishtar be taken to be two different
deities (as is possible), there is no bisexuality. The second
inscription, which is bilingual, has the expressions "the mother-father
Enlil," "the mother-father Ninlil" (Sumerian), rendered in
Semitic "the father-mother Enlil," "the father-mother Ninlil."
These expressions probably signify not that the two deities are bisexual,
but that each of them fulfills the guarding and nourishing
functions of a father and a mother.</p>

<p>The expression in a hymn to Ishtar that "she has a beard like
the god Ashur" may be satisfactorily explained as an astrological
statement, the meaning of which is that the planet Dilbat (Ishtar,
Venus) at certain times equals the sun (represented by Ashur)
in brilliancy, her rays being likened to a beard.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> A similar astrological
interpretation is offered by Jastrow of a passage (to which
attention was called by Fran&ccedil;ois Lenormant) in which a female
Dilbat and a male Dilbat are spoken of. Other astrological texts
indicate that the terms 'male' and 'female' are employed as
expressions of greater or less brilliancy.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> Lajard's view, that all
Babylonian and Assyrian deities were androgynous, hardly needs
discussion now.<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_409" id="p_409">409</a></b>. Of a more definite character are expressions in two Ph&oelig;nician
inscriptions. In an inscription of Eshmunazzar II (probably
early in the fourth century B.C.) the great goddess of Sidon is called
"Ashtart <i>Shem</i> Baal."<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> The word <i>shem</i> means 'name,' and, if it
be so interpreted as to give the goddess the name of a male divinity,
she may be understood to have partly male form. But such change
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>of name is hardly probable, and this is not necessarily the natural
force of the phrase. In Hebrew to "call one's name on a person
or thing" is to assert ownership in it or close connection with it.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a>
In the West Semitic area some personal names signify simply 'name
of such and such a deity,' as, for example, Shemuel (Samuel),
'name of El,' Shemzebul, 'name of (the god) Zebul,' denoting
devotion or subordination to the deity in question. "Shem Baal"
as a title of Ashtart may then indicate her close relation with the
god, or, perhaps, if the expression be understood more broadly,
her equality with him in power (the name of a deity involves his
attributes)&mdash;he was the great god, but she, the expression would
say, is not less mighty than he; or, less probably, <i>baal</i> may be taken
not as proper name but as title, the sense then being that the goddess
is the lord of the city.<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> Another proposal is to read "Ashtart
sham&#275; Baal," 'Ashtart of the heaven [sky] of Baal.'<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> There is a
Ph&oelig;nician Baal-shamem, 'lord of the sky,' but nowhere else is the
sky described as the abode of a baal, and the transference of the
local city-goddess to that region would be strange; nor in the expression
'Baal-shamem' is Baal a proper name&mdash;it is merely a title.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_410" id="p_410">410</a></b>. Another phrase, occurring in many Carthaginian inscriptions,
makes mention of "Tanit face of Baal,"<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> an expression that
may point to a female body with male face. Its indefiniteness&mdash;it
does not state the nature of the face (it may point to a beard)&mdash;makes
it difficult to draw from it any conclusions as to the character
of the deity named.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> But the probability is that it is identical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>in sense with the one mentioned above. Tanit was the great goddess
of Carthage; she is called "Adon," 'lord,' and her equality
with Baal is indicated by the statement that she had his face, the
word 'face' being here equivalent to 'personality' and 'power.'<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_411" id="p_411">411</a></b>. At a later period (early in the fifth century of our era) two
authors, Servius and Macrobius, make definite statements concerning
a bisexual cult, apparently Semitic.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> Both statements occur in
connection with Vergil's use of the masculine <i>deus</i> (<i>ducente deo</i>) as
a title of Venus, in explanation of which the cases of supposed bisexualism
are cited.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> What is said is that there was in Cyprus a
deity whose image was bearded&mdash;a god of virile nature, but dressed
as a woman, and regarded as being both male and female. Further,
Philochorus is quoted to the effect that men sacrificed to her in
women's dress and women in men's dress. This last remark does
not necessarily point to an androgynous deity, for exchange of
dress between men and women sometimes occurs where there is
no question of the cult of such a deity.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> But the Cyprian deity
is said also to have been called &#7944;&#966;&#961;&#8057;&#948;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#957; (Aphroditos? or Aphroditon?)<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a>&mdash;apparently
a male Aphrodite.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_412" id="p_412">412</a></b>. Leaving aside a few other notices that add nothing to
our knowledge of the point under consideration, we should naturally
conclude, if we give any credit to the statements of Servius
and Macrobius, that there was a report in their time of a bisexual
deity in Cyprus. As regards Vergil's "deus," that may be merely
a poetical expression of the eminence and potency of the goddess.
But the assertions of her bisexual character are distinct, even if the
"beard" be discarded. This latter may have come from a misunderstanding
of some appearance on the face of the statue; or,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>as has been suggested, there may have been a false beard attached
to it permanently or occasionally,<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> and from this may have sprung
the belief in the twofold nature of the deity. We are not told,
however, that such a nature was ascribed to Aphrodite, or that a
beard was attached to her statue; and, if this was done, it is difficult
to suppose that a popular belief in the bisexuality of a deity
could have arisen from such a procedure. Some better ground
for the statements of Servius and Macrobius there seems to have
been, though we do not know their authorities. In any case it
may be concluded that the cult in question, if it existed, was late,
popular, and without marked influence on the Semitic religious
development. No figures or other traces of a bisexual deity have
been discovered in Cyprus or elsewhere (unless the Carthaginian
Tanit be an exception), and all that is otherwise known of the
character and cult of the Babylonian Ishtar, the Ph&oelig;nician Ashtart,
and the Carthaginian Tanit (=Ashtart) is against the supposition
of bisexuality. Ishtar, originally a deity of fertility, became,
through social growth, a patron of war and statecraft; but there is
no indication that an attempt was ever made to combine these two
characters in one figure.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_413" id="p_413">413</a></b>. The Phrygian figure Agdistis, represented in the myths
as androgynous<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> (the myths being based on cults), is connected
with the worship of the Great Mother, Kybele (the embodiment
of the female productive power of nature), with whom is associated
Attis (the embodiment of the male power).<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> The myths identify
Agdistis on the one hand with Kybele, on the other hand with
Attis&mdash;he represents in his own person the combination of the two
generative powers. But it is doubtful whether this was his significance
in the actual worship, in which he hardly appears; he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>probably a divine figure of the same character as Kybele and Attis,
worked up by myth-makers and woven into the larger myth. His
self-castration reflects the practice of the priests and other worshipers
of Kybele.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> Thus culturally he is of little or no importance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_414" id="p_414">414</a></b>. There is no evidence that this Phrygian figure was derived
from Semitic sources. A certain similarity between Phrygian and
Syrian cults of gods and goddesses of fertility is obvious, and the
social relations between Asia Minor, Syria, and Cyprus make
borrowing in either direction conceivable. But cults of such deities
might grow up independently in different regions,<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> and the supposition
that the Phrygian worship was native to Asia Minor is favored
by the great elaboration of its ceremonies and by their barbarous
character. This character suggests that the worship may have originated
with savage peoples who preceded the Aryans in the country.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_415" id="p_415">415</a></b>. The most definite androgynous figure is the Greek Hermaphroditos.
It was only in Greece that such a compound name arose,
and that the composite form became established in art. It is not
certain when the Greek form was fixed. If the statement that Aristophanes
used the term "Aphroditos"<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> (or "Aphroditon") is to be
relied on, it must be concluded that the conception existed in Greece
prior to the fifth century, probably in that case as a popular usage
that was unorganized and unimportant, since it is not referred to in
the existing literature. But of this Aristophanes we know nothing,
and the vague statements of Servius and Macrobius may be neglected
as being without significance for the figure in question.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_416" id="p_416">416</a></b>. The name Hermaphroditos is said to occur for the first
time in the fourth or third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> This would indicate a
gradual formulation of the idea, the result being the combination
of two divine forms into a single form. Aphrodite would naturally
be chosen for the female side, and the ithyphallic Hermes is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>appropriate for the male side&mdash;possibly the Hermes pillar with
Aphrodite bust was the earliest form.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> The representations of
Hermaphrodites show a male body with female bust; the name
Aphroditos would rather suggest a female body with male additions.
Other Greek bisexual figures are forms of Priapos and Eros.</p>

<p>An historical connection between the Greek and the Phrygian
forms is possible, but is not proved. In India the bisexual form
of &Ccedil;iva, which seems to be late,<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> connects itself with the licentious
character of his rites. Its historical origin is uncertain.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_417" id="p_417">417</a></b>. It does not appear that the cult of the Greek androgynous
deities entered seriously into the religious life of the people. In late
philosophic circles they were treated merely as symbols of the creative
power of nature, and thus lost their character as persons.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_418" id="p_418">418</a></b>. The starting-point for the development of the hermaphrodite
figure may perhaps be found in two facts, the interchange or
change of sexual characters<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> and the combination of two deities to
express a broader idea than either of them represents. The assumption
of female dress and sexual habits by males, and of male
dress and habits by females, has prevailed over a great part of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> The embodiment of this fact in a composite divine form
would be not unnatural at a time when there was a disposition to
give expression, in the person of gods, to all human experiences.
Such definite embodiment is, however, rare in religious history, probably,
as is suggested above, because it involves a large generalization
and a more or less distinct symbolism. The first movement
in this direction may have been na&iuml;vely sensuous; later, as is remarked
above, the symbolic conception became predominant.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_419" id="p_419">419</a></b>. The association of certain <i>animals</i> with certain phallic deities
(as the bull with Dionysos, the goat with Pan, the ass with
Priapos) is a part of the general connection between gods and animals,
the grounds of which are in many cases obscure.<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> Pan's rural
character may explain his relation to the goat; the bull, the ass, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>many other animals regarded as sacred, may have been brought
into ritual connection with gods by processes of subordination of
divine beasts and through collocation of cults. There is no evidence
to show that the animals connected with phallic gods were selected
on account of their salacious dispositions or their sexual power.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_420" id="p_420">420</a></b>. Phallicistic cults, attenuated by advance of refinement, survived
long, even into Christian times, under modified forms.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> In
such cases they become merely devices of ignorant piety. When
the aid of a Christian saint is sought in order to secure fertility, the
trust in the phallus-symbol involves no unworthy desire; and what
is true of medieval European peoples may have been true of ancient
peoples. In the ancient world these cults took many forms, ranging
from na&iuml;ve faith to frank obscenity on the one hand and philosophic
breadth on the other hand. They take their place as part
of the general worship of the forces of nature, and follow all the
variations of human culture.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>TOTEMISM AND TABOO</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_421" id="p_421">421</a></b>. Totemism and taboo are both of them intimately connected
with the history of early religion, but in different ways. Totemism
is not essentially religious if religion be held to involve worship of
superhuman or extrahuman beings; it has, however, in many cases
coalesced with religious practices and ideas, and it is sometimes
difficult to draw the line distinctly between it and religion proper.
Taboo, on the other hand, is founded on magical conceptions, and
these are nearly allied to the basis of early religion; it is more or
less prominent in all early cults, and has survived in the higher religious
systems, though in these it is generally spiritualized. The
two lines of development, totemism and taboo, appear side by side
in early cults, and influence each the other; but their functions
in the social organization of religion have been different, and they
are best treated separately. As the collections of material for their
history are still incomplete, accounts of them must be regarded as,
to a greater or less extent, provisional.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Totemism</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_422" id="p_422">422</a></b>. The natural attraction of human beings for one another
and the necessity of providing effective means of defense against
enemies have led men to associate themselves together in clans
and tribes. In such associations some form of organization arose
as a matter of course; experience early showed that men could not
live together except under the guidance and control of authoritative
regulations. Such regulations dealt with fundamental facts of life,
which in the beginnings of society are mostly physical. The points
requiring regulation are: the relation of man to nonhuman things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
(animals, plants, and inanimate objects); the maintenance of rights
of life and property; and the sexual relations between human beings,
especially marriage as the basis of the family. The determination
of what things may be eaten belongs more particularly under
"taboo," and is considered below. Customs and rules designed
to protect life and property have always coalesced with religious
systems; they are mentioned in connection with the ethical element
in religion.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> The other points&mdash;relations to nonhuman things and
sexual relations&mdash;may be conveniently considered together here;
but, as the second point belongs rather to sociology than to the
history of religion, it will be sufficient, with an introductory word
on marriage restrictions (under <i>Exogamy</i>), to give the facts in
connection with the various totemic organizations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_423" id="p_423">423</a></b>. <i>Exogamy.</i><a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> All over the savage world the general rule
prevails (though not without exceptions) that a man must not
marry a woman of his own clan; though the family proper (husband,
wife, and children) exists, the clan is the fundamental social
unit. When a tribe contains several clans it is commonly divided
into groups (phratries), each phratry including certain clans, and
the rule then is that a man shall not marry a woman of his phratry.
Usually the number of phratries is two, but in some cases (as among
the Australian Arunta and adjoining tribes) these are divided so that
there are four or eight exogamous groups (subphratries). When
the totem is hereditary the totemic clans are exogamous; otherwise
(as among the Arunta) marriage between persons of the same clan
is permitted.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_424" id="p_424">424</a></b>. Whether the clan or the phratry preceded in time it is hardly
possible to determine&mdash;clans may have united to form a larger
group, or an original group may have been divided into clans. But
in the latter case this original group was practically a clan, so
that the question of precedence in time is not important. Where
clan exogamy exists without phratries it is possible that these also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>formerly existed and have been dropped in the interests of freedom&mdash;that
is, they limited the choice of a wife to an extent that
proved inconvenient.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_425" id="p_425">425</a></b>. An almost universal feature of the marriage rules of low
tribes is the classificatory system of relationship. According to this
system, the community being divided into groups, terms of relationship
indicate not kinship in blood but tribal status in respect
of marriageability; thus, the same term is used for a child's real
father and for every man who might legally have become the
husband of his mother, and the same term for the real mother
and for every woman whom the father might have married;
the children of such possible fathers and mothers are the child's
brothers and sisters; all possible spouses are called a man's
"wives" or a woman's "husbands"; and similarly with all relationships.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_426" id="p_426">426</a></b>. The system has many varieties of form, and gives way in
time to the formal recognition of blood kinship. It has been held
to point to an earlier system of "group marriage," in which all
the men of one group had marital relations with all the women of
another group, and further to a primitive custom of sexual promiscuity.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a>
In the nature of the case these hypotheses do not admit of
proof or disproof. All that is certain is that the classificatory system
has been and is an accompaniment of one stage of social and religious
development.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_427" id="p_427">427</a></b>. The effect of exogamous arrangements has been to prevent
marriage between persons related in blood.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> In totemic
organizations, when the totem is inherited, a division into two
exogamous groups makes marriage of brother to sister impossible,
since all the children of one mother are in the same group; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>if there are four such groups and children are assigned to a group
different from that of the father and that of the mother, marriage
between parent and child is impossible. When the totem is not inherited
(as is the case among the Australian Arunta) similar results
are secured by a further subdivision.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_428" id="p_428">428</a></b>. The particular exogamic customs vary considerably among
early tribes, the differences following, in general, differences of
social organization. In some more settled savage communities (as,
for example, the Kurnai of Southeast Australia), in which there are
neither classes nor totemic clans, marriage is permitted only between
members of certain districts.<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> Well-organized social life tends to
promote individual freedom in marriage as in other things. Marriage
with a half-sister was allowed by the old Hebrew law,<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> and
Egyptian kings often married their sisters.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_429" id="p_429">429</a></b>. <i>Theories of the origin of exogamy.</i> Exogamy has been referred
to a supposed scarcity of women, which forced the young
men to seek wives abroad.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> On the assumption of early sexual
promiscuity it has been regarded as a deliberate attempt to prevent
the marriage of blood relations.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> It has been supposed to result
from the absence of sexual attraction between persons who have
been brought up together.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> An original human horde being assumed,
it has been suggested that the patriarch, who had possession of all
the women of the horde, would, from jealousy, drive the young
men off to seek wives elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> From the point of view of the
totem as divine ancestor, exogamy has been supposed to arise from
religious respect for the clan blood, which is held to share the divinity
of the totem, and would be polluted (with danger to the clan)
by outside marriages.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span><b><a name="p_430" id="p_430">430</a></b>. Objections may be raised to all these theories. It is doubtful
whether a scarcity of women existed in early times; and supposing
that there were not women enough in a clan for the men
of the clan, this would not stand in the way of men's taking as
wives their clan women.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> The assumption of primitive sexual
promiscuity, likewise, cannot be said to be distinctly borne out
by known facts.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> Morgan's theory, however, is not dependent on
this assumption&mdash;it need only suppose repugnance to the marriage
of blood relations. Such repugnance granted, the main objection
to the theory rests on the difficulty of supposing savages capable
of originating so thoughtful and elastic a scheme as the exogamous
system. This is a point on which it is not possible to speak positively.
The lowest tribes have produced languages of wonderfully
intricate and delicate construction, and, supposing the process of
constructing marriage regulations to have gone on during a very
long period, modifications introduced from time to time, to meet
conditions felt to be important, might conceivably result in such
exogamous systems as are now found.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_431" id="p_431">431</a></b>. As to absence of sexual attraction between persons brought
up together,<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> this seems to be a result rather than a cause of the prohibition
of sexual relations between certain classes of persons. The
argument from habits of the lower animals is indefinite&mdash;no general
habit has been proven. In orgies in India and elsewhere no repulsion
appears between persons of the same family. In the ancient
world marriage between such persons was legal and not uncommon.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_432" id="p_432">432</a></b>. The human horde, with its jealous patriarch, appears to be
a creation of the scientific imagination. It, again, was derived by
its author from the procedure of certain beast-herds in which the
strongest male drives away his rivals. It is supposed, however,
that in the human horde the young men, having found wives, are
allowed to come back bringing their wives with them, and these
last the patriarch is supposed not to appropriate. The theory is
supported by no facts of actual usage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span><b><a name="p_433" id="p_433">433</a></b>. The supposition that the young men of a clan or tribe go
off to seek food, and thus found a new clan, has more in its favor.
Being compelled to seek wives in their new surroundings, they might
thus initiate a habit of outside marriage that would in time become
general usage and therefore sacred. Secession from tribes does occur,
and may have been frequent in prehistoric times, but concerning
these times we have little or no information. It may be said that
movements of this sort would furnish a more probable starting-point
for savage customs than the ideas and schemes mentioned above.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_434" id="p_434">434</a></b>. Proof is lacking also for Durkheim's theory. It is not
probable that the totem was regarded as divine in the period in
which exogamy arose&mdash;by the tribes whose ideas on this point are
known the totem is looked on as a friend and an equal but not as
a god. And, as is pointed out above, there is no such general religious
respect for the clan blood as would forbid sexual intercourse
between persons of the same clan. The demand for revenge for
the murder of a clansman arises from the sense of clan solidarity
and the necessity of self-defense&mdash;it is only in this regard that the
blood of the clan is regarded as sacred.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_435" id="p_435">435</a></b>. Horror of marriage or of sexual intercourse in general,
within the prohibited degrees or areas, is universal in low communities;
violation of the tribal law on this point is severely punished,
sometimes with death. Whence this feeling sprang is not
clear.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> It cannot have arisen from respect for the purity of women
or from a belief in the sanctity of the family&mdash;intercourse with girls
before their marriage is freely allowed, and lending or exchange
of wives is common. Magical dangers are supposed to follow on
infringement of marriage rules, but, as such results come from
violation of any tribal custom, this throws no light on the origin
of the feeling of horror in question. Absence of sexual attraction
between persons brought up together,<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> though the absence of such
feeling is said to have been observed in some of the lower animals,
is not assured for savages; its existence in civilized communities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>is due to the acceptance of the established usage, which makes
certain unions impossible, so that they are not considered, and
the germ of such a public opinion may perhaps be assumed for
early tribes. Probably the horror of incest is a derivation from
economic and other situations and laws that arose naturally in
early society&mdash;it is a habit hardened into an instinct.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_436" id="p_436">436</a></b>. Though exogamy differs from totemism in origin and function,
the two are often found associated&mdash;their conjunction may
be said to be the general rule. There are, however, exceptions.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a>
Totemic clans are not exogamous in Central Australia, the Melanesian
Banks Islands, among the Nandi of East Africa, and the
Bakuana of South Africa. On the other hand, exogamy is found
without totemism in the tribes just mentioned, among the Todas of
Southern India, in Sumatra, among the African Masai and Ashanti,
and in Southern Nigeria, and local exogamy among tribes (for
example, the Kurnai of Southeast Australia, and the Californian
Maidu and Shasta) in which totemic divisions are not perceptible.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_437" id="p_437">437</a></b>. In all such cases, however, the absence of records makes
the history of the organizations uncertain&mdash;we do not know whether
or not one of the elements, totemism or exogamy, formerly existed
and has yielded to disintegrating influences. Thus local exogamy
may have superseded clan exogamy in many places, the former
representing the more settled habit of life, and the absence of the
totemic constitution may indicate a process of decay of totemism.
No general rule for the decision of the question can be laid down&mdash;every
case must be judged for itself.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_438" id="p_438">438</a></b>. Since a custom of exogamy presupposes at least two social
groups (clans), and totemism appears to be connected originally with
single clans, the natural inference is that the latter has everywhere
preceded the former in time. Both have undergone great changes
produced by similar sets of circumstances, and in both cases the
simplest form is probably the oldest, though here again definite
data are lacking. However, comparison of the known exogamous
systems points to a two-group arrangement as that from which
the existing forms have come.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span><b><a name="p_439" id="p_439">439</a></b>. Exogamy served a good purpose in early stages of society,
both by preventing marriages between blood relations and by inducing
a sense of the sacredness of the marriage bond. Its long
persistence shows that it was regarded by most tribes as necessary
for the maintenance of the tribal life. Its restriction of individual
freedom in the choice of wives was an evil, and was in time modified
and finally thrown off; but it seems to have been the only
means, discoverable by early society, by which clans and tribes
could live peaceably side by side, and it paved the way for the
establishment of the family proper.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_440" id="p_440">440</a></b>. This brief account of the most important adjunct of
totemism may serve to clear the way for the consideration of
the totemic system.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_441" id="p_441">441</a></b>. Among the various relations that undeveloped communities
sustain to nonhuman things totemism has the peculiarity that it is
an alliance between a human group (clan or tribe) and a species
of animals or plants, or an inanimate natural object (as sun or
moon), or, rarely, an artificial object (usually an implement of
labor).<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> The nonhuman thing is regarded as a friend, and is respected
and cared for accordingly. When it is a species (animal
or plant) every individual of the species is held to bear this friendly
relation to every individual of the allied human group. Generally
there is believed to be not only similarity or identity of nature
between the two (such identity of nature between man and nonhuman
things is everywhere an article of the creed of savages)
but a special intimacy, commonly a kinship of blood. While the
men of a group respect their ally, it, on its part, is supposed to
refrain from injuring them, and even in some cases to aid them.
It is credited with great power, such as in savage life all nonhuman
things are supposed to possess. The members of the human group
regard one another as brothers; this feeling, however, can hardly
be said to be peculiar to totemic organizations&mdash;it exists, more or
less, in all early associations, particularly in any one association as
against others.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_442" id="p_442">442</a></b>. While, therefore, we may take a certain clan alliance as a
fundamental fact of totemism, we find in various communities other
features of organization more or less closely combined with this
into a social unity. In every such case it is necessary to inquire
whether the feature in question is a universal or general accompaniment
of clan alliance, and whether it is peculiar to the latter
or is found in other systems also.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_443" id="p_443">443</a></b>. (a) <i>Exogamy.</i> It is pointed out above<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> that totemism and
exogamy are mutually independent arrangements, differing in function
and origin, each being found without the other. Yet in many
cases, perhaps in the majority of cases, the two are found combined.
Exogamy supposes a body of clans, and, given a group of totemic
clans, it would naturally be attached to these, and so become an
organic part of their social constitution. Where there is no totemism
the question of union, of course, does not come up. Where
totemism is not accompanied by exogamy it is sometimes probable
that the union of the two once existed,<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> or that exogamy is excluded
by the peculiar form of the totemism.<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> Exogamy may thus be regarded
as a natural and frequent accompaniment of totemism, but
it is not a universal and necessary element of the totemic constitution.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_444" id="p_444">444</a></b>. (b) <i>Names.</i> As a general rule the totemic clan bears the
name of its totem. The exceptions appear to be found in somewhat
advanced communities, as the Fijians and the Kwakiutl (but
not the northern branch of this tribe).<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> There are also many larger
exogamous groups (as, for example, in Australia) the meaning of
whose names is obscure&mdash;they may or may not contain the name
of the totem; but such groups may have a different origin from
that of the totemic clans.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_445" id="p_445">445</a></b>. In some cases clans and tribes have distinctive <i>crests</i> or
<i>badges</i>, generally totemic figures or parts of such figures. These
are carved on beams of houses and on house poles, or cut or drawn
on men's persons, and are used as signs manual, serving thus to
indicate to strangers a man's clan connections. Such emblems are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>employed in the Torres Straits islands and British New Guinea,<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a>
in the Aru Islands (southwest of New Guinea), and in North
America among the Len&acirc;p&eacute; (Delawares), the Pueblo tribes, the
Tlingit, the Haidas, and the Kwakiutl.<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_446" id="p_446">446</a></b>. In America the crest is not always identical in name with
the totem, and sometimes coalesces with the guardian animal-spirit.
The myths that give the origin of the crest usually describe some
adventure (marriage or other) of a man with the crest animal, involving
sometimes, but not always, the origin of the clan.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> The
relation between totem and crest thus differs in different places,
and its origin is not clear. The simplest form of this relation
(that found in the New Guinea region) may indicate that the
totem animal, being most intimately connected with the clan, is
chosen on that account as its badge. Or possibly totem and
crest have arisen, independently of each other, from some early
affiliation with animals, and therefore do not always coincide.
Such a mode of origination would help to explain the fact that in
Northwestern America a clan may have several crests, and a man
also may acquire more than one. The relation of crest to clan is
looser than that of totem to clan&mdash;the same crest or crests are
found in different clans. When the totemic constitution of the
tribe or clan is weakened, the crest may become more important
than the totem, as is the case among the Haidas. But the adoption
of the crest name does not invalidate the general rule that
the clan bears the name of its totem.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_447" id="p_447">447</a></b>. Names of families and of persons do not come into consideration
here. They arise from various local and personal peculiarities
that, as a rule, have nothing to do with totemism, and they
become more prominent and important as the latter declines.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_448" id="p_448">448</a></b>. The origin of clan totemic names is closely connected with
the origin of the totemic organization, and will be more conveniently
considered in connection with this point.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span><b><a name="p_449" id="p_449">449</a></b>. (c) <i>Descent from the totem.</i> Details so far reported as to
this belief are regrettably few and often indefinite, and it is not
possible to give more than a provisional sketch of it.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> In Central
Australia it is held that all the members of a clan come into being

as identical in blood and nature with the totem.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> Similar beliefs
are reported as existing in New South Wales and West Australia,
and a definite conception of descent from the totem has been found
in the Santa Cruz group in Southern Melanesia, in Fiji in Eastern
Melanesia, and apparently in Tonga and Tikopia.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> In North
America the belief is reported as existing among the Len&acirc;p&eacute; (Delawares)

among the Arawaks of Guiana,<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> and perhaps elsewhere. For Africa
there is little information on this point, and what we have is not
always definite;<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> one of the clearest expressions of descent is
found in the title "grandfather" given to the chameleon by the
Chameleon clan of the Herrero of German Southwest Africa, but
a comparison with the similar title given by the Zulus to a sort of
divine ancestor, and with the Herrero mythical stories of the origins
of certain clans, suggests that the conception is vague.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_450" id="p_450">450</a></b>. In addition to the more direct statements there are traditions
or myths that connect the origin of clans with animals or
plants through the intermediation of gods or human beings, by
marriage, or some other relation. The Bushbuck clan of the East
African Baganda worship a lion-god, who is called an ancestor and
is said to have turned into a lion at his death. Fluctuating opinions
(some persons holding to direct descent from a nonhuman object,
others to friendly relations between it and the ancestor) are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>reported in Sumatra, Borneo, and the Moluccas. The Hurons regarded
the rattlesnake as a kinsman of their ancestor. The origin
of the clan or family is referred to marriage with an animal by the
Borneo Dyaks and various tribes on the African Gold Coast, and
to marriage with a plant by some of the Upper Liluet;<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> and the
origin of the crests in Northwestern America is ascribed to adventures
with crest animals.<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> In the Trobriand group of islands (lying
to the northeast of British New Guinea) the totems are said to have
been brought by the first men; naturally it is not explained whence
and how the men got them.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_451" id="p_451">451</a></b>. These instances of indirect origination (to which others of
the sort might be added) show a variety of points of view, and
may be variously interpreted. They may be regarded as declensions
from an earlier belief in the direct descent of the clan from
the totem, or as independent conceptions that never grew into this
belief. Both these ideas of the form of descent are found in widely
separated regions and in communities differing one from another
in general culture and in the degree of importance they attach to
the totemic constitution. The possibility of general agreement in
myths, with difference in details, between tribes remote from one
another is illustrated by the creation myths of the Australian
Arunta (who have an elaborate totemism) and the Thompson
River Indians of Northwestern America (who have no clan totems,
secret societies, or dramatic ceremonies); both relate transformations
of primitive unformed persons, but in the former the creators
are half-human, half-animal, in the latter they are men who transform
half-human, half-animal beings. Such widespread variations
point to early differences in social conditions and in intellectual
endowments with the nature of which we are not acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_452" id="p_452">452</a></b>. (d) <i>Refusal to kill or eat the totem.</i> The usages in regard
to killing or eating the totem are so diverse, and often so uncertain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>that it is not possible to lay down a general rule of prohibition.
An edible totem is only a peculiar sort of sacred animal or plant,
and respect for such objects often leads to refusal to kill or eat
them&mdash;an interdiction of this sort does not in itself show whether
or not the object in question is a totem. But within totemic areas
the usage varies in a remarkable manner, as, for example, in
Australia. In the north there is complete prohibition, sometimes
including the totems of a man's father, mother, and father's father.
Among the central tribes a man kills his clan totem only for the
benefit of other clans, and eats a little of it ceremonially. In the
southeast the Dieri, it is said, kill and eat their totems freely, while
other tribes, the Wotjoballuk and others, eat them only at a pinch.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a>
The northeastern tribes have many food taboos, which, however,
relate not to the totemic clans but to the exogamous subclasses.
A modified regard for the totem or crest (kobong) appears in
West Australia, according to Sir George Grey's report<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a>; it is
not allowable to kill a family kobong while it is asleep, and it is
always with reluctance that it is killed.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_453" id="p_453">453</a></b>. Abstention from killing and eating the totem holds, as a
rule, in the Torres Straits islands, while in New Guinea the custom
varies&mdash;the totem is eaten by some tribes, not eaten by
others.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_454" id="p_454">454</a></b>. In Melanesia the food restrictions connected with animal
patrons or friends of clans are less definite than in Australia.
Here, also, there are local differences of usage. Prohibition of eating
or using the totem (fish, grass, fowl, and so forth) was found
by Rivers in the Santa Cruz group (in Southern Melanesia) but
not in the northern New Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> In the central islands the
prohibition refers to the exogamous classes, and a similar usage is
reported as existing in the Duke of York group (in the north).
The Fijians refrain from eating their tribal sacred animals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span><b><a name="p_455" id="p_455">455</a></b>. In Polynesia family gods appear instead of totems, and
the incarnations of gods (in animals and plants) are not eaten;
such is the rule in Samoa and Tonga, and this was formerly the
practice in Hawaii. The food restrictions in Borneo and Sumatra
are not definitely totemic.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_456" id="p_456">456</a></b>. The non-Aryan tribes of India generally refrain from eating
their totems, or, in some cases, from injuring or using them;
and this is true even of those tribes (for example, the Khonds and
Oraons of Bengal) that have somewhat developed theistic systems.
Occasionally exemptions from the rule of abstention are procured,
perhaps under Aryan influence; such influence has affected many
of the tribes, but has not usually destroyed the old totemic customs.
Among the Todas (in the south), however, Rivers found only
feeble suggestions of totemic objects and food restrictions; the
buffalo-cult seems to have ousted all others.<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_457" id="p_457">457</a></b>. Among the native tribes of Africa there is special respect
for the object with which the clan or tribe has particularly definite
relations. The Bakuana do not eat the animal whose name is
borne by the clan; if an animal (the lion, for example) is dangerous,
it is killed with an apology. The Herrero (of German Southeast
Africa) abstain from the flesh of the chameleon, and will not
eat gray sheep or oxen. Among the half-civilized Baganda, of the
east, certain of the clans refrain from eating the object from which
a clan takes its name; the noteworthy political organization of
these people seems to have obliterated old clan functions in part.
In the west (Senegambia, Ashanti, Dahomi, Nigeria, Congo) there
are food restrictions, but these are not generally connected with
totemic social organizations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_458" id="p_458">458</a></b>. There is little evidence for totemic food restrictions in North
America. The custom of apologizing to an animal on killing it,
frequent elsewhere, is reported as existing among the Algonkin
Ottawas and Menomini; but this is not necessarily totemic. The
more advanced tribes of the East and South (Algonkin, Iroquois,
Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasas, Cherokees, Natchez), the peoples of
the Pacific Coast, and the agricultural tribes of the middle of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>continent (Pueblos, Mandans, and others) appear to be free from
restrictions as to eating. The Navahos are said to refrain from
the flesh of fish, turkeys, swine, and bears, but the grounds of the
interdiction are not clear.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> The distinctest evidence of totemistic
clan food-taboos are found among the Siouan Caddos (of the
southern Mississippi Valley) and the Omahas (of the Middle
West). Both these groups are in part agricultural, and it does
not appear how they have come to differ from their neighbors
in this regard. Food restrictions are reported for the Northwest
region.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_459" id="p_459">459</a></b>. There is no clear report of totemic food restrictions in
Central America or in South America;<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> but these regions have as
yet not been thoroughly examined for clan usages.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_460" id="p_460">460</a></b>. (e) <i>Magical ceremonies for increasing the supply of food.</i>
Such ceremonies exist, or have existed, in many regions and among
peoples of various grades of culture, civilized as well as savage,
but the cases in which they are, or were, conducted by totemistic
clans are comparatively few. This sort of economic function of
the totem clan is most definite and important in Central and parts
of Southeast Australia, where every clan is charged with the
duty of increasing the supply of its totem for the benefit of its
connected clans; and magical rites are performed in the fertile
coast region no less than in the arid region about Lake Eyre&mdash;that
is, in these cases the employment of magic seems not to be
conditioned on the natural resources of the land. Similar totemic
clan functions appear in the islands of Torres Straits, the Turtle
and Dugong clans performing ceremonies to increase the supply
of turtles and to attract dugongs. Magical control of totems for
the benefit of the whole community is reported to be found in the
Siouan Omaha clans (in the center of the North American continent).
The tribes just mentioned are those in which the social
organization is definitely totemistic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span><b><a name="p_461" id="p_461">461</a></b>. Elsewhere the economic function attaches to other bodies
than totemic clans, as in parts of Southeast Australia, and in
West Australia (where the ceremonies are conducted by the exogamous
classes). In New Guinea the totemic character of the
performances appears to be doubtful. A single instance of clan
action has been found among the East African Baganda&mdash;the
women of the Grasshopper clan undertake to increase the supply
of their totem; why this duty is assigned to the women is not
clear&mdash;the custom appears to involve a relaxation of totemistic
rules. The economic festivals and "dances" of the Siouan Mandans
and Hidatsa are general tribal ceremonies. Among the
Pueblo Indians such rites are the care of religious fraternities;<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a>
the Zu&ntilde;i Frog clan performs a ceremony to procure rain, but
this duty is mainly committed to rain-priests. In Northwestern
America the magical performances are not connected with totemic
clans.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_462" id="p_462">462</a></b>. <i>Definition of totemism.</i> It appears, then, that not one of
the points just mentioned is found invariably in the systems of
organization commonly called totemic. Exogamy is an independent
phenomenon; the clan does not always bear the name of the
totem, and is not always held to have descended from it; usages
in regard to eating it vary greatly; magical economic ceremonies
are performed by other than totemic bodies. There is no known
clan that includes all these elements in its organization, though in
Central Australia there is an approach to complete inclusion; the
features lacking are clan exogamy and absolute prohibition of eating
the totem, but practically a clan does not eat its totem, and
exogamy, for reasons given above, may be left out of consideration.
The Central Australian system may be said to be substantially
complete; with it the North American systems stand in sharp
contrast, and from it many others diverge.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_463" id="p_463">463</a></b>. But, with all these differences, the fact remains that in
totemism the human group stands in a peculiar relation to some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>nonhuman object.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> This general statement must, however, be defined
in two particulars: the relation is an alliance for the benefit of
both parties; and the nonhuman object is not regarded as a god and
is not worshiped. The first of these particulars marks totemism
off from that general regard that is paid by savages to animals,
plants, certain heavenly bodies, and other physical things;<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> the
second particular distinguishes it from the cult of ghosts and gods
proper. We may therefore define it as an alliance, offensive and defensive,
between a human group and a nonhuman group or object
that is not worshiped, the friendly relation existing between every
member of the one group and every member of the other group.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_464" id="p_464">464</a></b>. This relation having been formed, the various features
mentioned above will naturally become attached to it in various
ways and to different extents. The clan will somehow get a name,
when and how we need not now ask; usually its name is that of
the totem&mdash;this is in keeping with the intimate connection between
the two. To trace the origin of the clan to the totem is only to do
what is done abundantly among uncivilized and civilized peoples
(Hebrews, Greeks, and others); the eponymous ancestor is constructed
out of the current name of the clan. To refrain from killing
or eating a friendly animal or plant is a simple mark of respect.
The conception of special ability in a clan to insure a supply of its
totem for food is in accord with savage ideas of magical endowment.
When the custom of exogamy arose it would naturally attach
to the clan as the social unit.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_465" id="p_465">465</a></b>. In view of the diverse physical surroundings of the tribes
of the earth and their intellectual differences, it cannot be surprising
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>that they have combined these elements of organization in various
ways. In their efforts to secure food, good marriage relations, protection
of property, and defense against enemies, they have from
time to time adopted such measures as the circumstances made
desirable and possible. There is evidence that in some instances
clans have changed their social regulations, sometimes by a process
of internal growth, sometimes by borrowing from without. It is
not always possible to trace such movements, and it is impossible
now to say what the earliest social constitution of men was. The
probability is that the earliest state was an unformed one, without
governmental or other institutions, and that totemism was one of
the first attempts to introduce order into society. In accordance
with what is said above, the term 'totemism' may be used to
mean particularly a simple alliance between men and nonhuman
things, and then more generally to mean such an alliance combined
in whatever way, with one or more of the particular customs
described in preceding paragraphs.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_466" id="p_466">466</a></b>. <i>Geographical survey of totemistic usages.</i> If totemism be
taken in the simpler sense, as a certain sort of intimate relation
between men and nonhuman things, it will be found to be widely
distributed in the noncivilized world. Its occurrence becomes rarer
in proportion as adjuncts are attached to it; as is remarked above,
it is hardly possible to find a clan whose constitution embraces
all adjuncts. Where usages like exogamy occur, or where there is
reverence for an object, without belief in a definite, nontheistic
relation between a human clan and a nonhuman object, we cannot
recognize totemism proper; such usages must be treated as
belonging to man's general attitude toward his nonhuman associates.
The question whether they represent germinal or decadent
totemism, or neither, must be considered separately in
every case.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_467" id="p_467">467</a></b>. The two great totemistic regions of the world are Australia
and North America, and in each of these the variations of custom
run through the gamut of possible differences. In each of them
also the native population may include different stocks, though on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>this point there is uncertainty. Differences of climate and topographical
situations there are, but these do not always account for
the diversities of culture and custom.<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_468" id="p_468">468</a></b>. <i>Australia.</i> In the heart of Central Australia (the home of
the Arunta and other tribes) there are clans that bear the names
of their totems, and trace their descent from half-human totem
ancestors, with whom they consider themselves to be identical;
totems, however, are not hereditary, but are determined by the
ancestor connected with the place where the mother first becomes
aware of the child within her; each clan performs magical ceremonies
to secure a supply of its totem for the associated clans, and,
when the totem is an animal or a plant, hunts or gathers it and
brings it to be distributed; at the distribution the headman of the
providing clan must eat a little of the food ceremonially, and at
other times clansmen eat of it sparingly;<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> the rule of exogamy relates
not to the totemic clans, but to the phratries or subphratries.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_469" id="p_469">469</a></b>. In the South Central region these features are found, with
an exception in the rule concerning eating one's totem. Sometimes,
as in the Urabanna tribe, such eating is forbidden. But among the
Warramunga there is a relaxation of the rule in the case of old
people&mdash;for them the food restriction is removed (apparently
a humanitarian provision); on the other hand, for other clansfolk
there is an extension of the rule&mdash;the prohibition includes two
subclasses of the moiety to which the clan belongs, and conditionally
includes the whole moiety (this is perhaps a cautionary measure,
to guard against the possibility of unlawful eating on the part
of clansmen).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_470" id="p_470">470</a></b>. The special feature in North Australia (on the shores of
the Gulf of Carpentaria) is the absolute prohibition of eating the
totem. In regard to the performance of magical ceremonies for
increase of the totem also there is the peculiarity that a clan is not
bound to conduct such performances&mdash;it is optional with it to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>so or not; it has magical power, but is not required by custom to
exercise it. It is suggested by Spencer and Gillen that this variation
from the usage of the Central region is to be attributed to the
more regular rainfall on the coast, which insures a more regular
supply of food and thus does away with the necessity for magic.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a>
Possibly, also, this climatic feature may account for the stricter rule
of prohibition mentioned above; as the rule is sometimes relaxed
when it is hard to get food, so, on the other hand, it may be strictly
enforced when food is plentiful.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_471" id="p_471">471</a></b>. Still a different situation appears in the southeastern part
of the continent (New South Wales and Victoria)&mdash;several prominent
features of the Central system are absent. The Dieri clans
bear the names of their totems, from which also they think themselves
descended, but they eat them freely. Some adjacent tribes
eat them only at a pinch, others refrain from them. The clans of
the Narrinyeri are mostly localized, and the clan-names are not
now those of the totems;<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> the totems are eaten. The Kurnai show
the greatest divergence from the ordinary type&mdash;they have neither
totemic clans nor exogamous classes; their rule of exogamy relates
to districts. Throughout the southeast the conduct of magical economic
ceremonies by clans, every clan being responsible for its own
totem, seems not to exist.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_472" id="p_472">472</a></b>. In certain tribes (the Wotjoballuk, the Yuin, the Kurnai,
and others) there are sex-patrons, animals intimately related to
all the males or all the females of the tribe; the belief is said to
be that the life of any individual of the animal group is the life
of a man or a woman, and neither sex group will kill its patron
animal. So far as regards the conception of identity with the
animal and reverence for it, the institution agrees with the usual
totemic type; but since it is not connected with clans, some such
designation for the animal as "patron" or "guardian" is to be
preferred to "totem."<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> Such animals, protectors of sexes, are
of rare occurrence, having been certainly found so far only in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>Southeast Australia, and they occur in a body of tribes that show a
disposition to discard the clan constitution. In this region individual
men also sometimes have animal guardians, so that a general tendency
toward individualism may be recognized. It is not unnatural
to connect this tendency with the fertility of the south coast, which
may weaken the clan organization. The organization by sex is a
singular phenomenon, of the history of which there are no records.
It is doubtless a special development of the widespread separation
of the sexes, combined with an increasing recognition of the property
rights and the social equality of women. At an early age boys
were often kept apart from girls. Special taboos, of food and
other things, were imposed on women. On the other hand, they
were in some cases the owners of the tribal property, and were
sometimes admitted to membership in secret societies. The
organization of the sex would follow under peculiarly favorable
conditions.<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_473" id="p_473">473</a></b>. The remaining districts of Australia have been less carefully
investigated than the central and southern parts, and information
about their totemistic customs is not always satisfactory. So
far as the accounts go there is a widespread divergence from simple
clan organization in these districts. In Northeast Australia (Queensland)
there are exogamous subclasses, and no clan taboos. In the
southwest not clans but families are the social units; these trace
their descent from animals, and there are individual animal patrons.
In the northwest no clan organization is reported; there is class
exogamy, and in the magical ceremonies the performers are taken
from the exogamous classes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_474" id="p_474">474</a></b>. <i>Torres Straits Islands.</i> These noteworthy variations in the
totemism of the Australian continent appear to be connected in a
general way with differences of climate and the degree of isolation
of the clans and tribes. Similar variations appear in the Torres
Straits islands and in British New Guinea. In the western islands
of the Straits (the only part in which distinct totemism has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>found) the social organization is to a certain extent independent of
totemic relations: the clans are locally segregated, and marriage
is mainly regulated by blood-kinship. On the other hand, an intimate
relation between a man and his totem is recognized&mdash;the
latter, as a rule, is not eaten by the related clansmen (there are
exceptions), magical economic ceremonies are performed by certain
clans, and there is clan exogamy. A possible survival of an early
social arrangement is the existence of subsidiary totems.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_475" id="p_475">475</a></b>. There is also a rudimentary cult of heroes: two of these
(animal in form) have shrines and effigies, annual dances are performed
in their honor, and stones are shown in which their souls
are supposed to dwell. The resemblance of this cult to certain forms
of worship in Polynesia (in Samoa, for example) is apparent; the
stones may be compared with similar abodes of superhuman animals
or spirits in Central Australia and elsewhere; the myths connect
the two animal heroes with the origin of totems&mdash;a common procedure.
One hero, Kwoiam of Mabuiag, is said to have been a real
man, and to have been almost deified; divinization of dead men is
not unusual in Polynesia.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_476" id="p_476">476</a></b>. <i>New Guinea.</i> In the eastern portion of British New Guinea
the peculiarities of organization are<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> that the people live in hamlets;
that there is generally a combination of totems in a clan; and that
special regard is paid to the father's totem. There is no report of
belief in descent from the totem.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> The hamlets tend to become family
groups, but clan exogamy is observed. The system of "linked
totems" seems to be designed to secure superhuman aid from all
departments of the nonhuman world: ordinarily there will be a
bird, a fish, a snake, and a plant&mdash;the bird has come to be the
most important of these. A man may kill his own totem but not
his father's&mdash;a rule that has arisen perhaps from a displacement
of matrilineal descent (according to which a man's totem is that of
his mother) by descent through the father. So far as appears, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>are no magical ceremonies for increase of the supply of food. In
both New Guinea and the Straits the fact that old customs are
disappearing under foreign influence increases the difficulty of determining
whether certain usages are primitive or decadent.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_477" id="p_477">477</a></b>. <i>Melanesia.</i> The social organization in the vast mass of
islands called Melanesia<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> has not been fully investigated, but the
existence of some general features has been established. Society
is divided not into clans or tribes, but into exogamous classes, and
the classificatory system of relationships is general. The rules governing
marriage are less elaborate than in Australia, the method
of initiation is simpler, and the political organization is more definite.
In regard to other usages commonly associated with totemism
the reported details are not numerous. There appears to be
a movement away from Australian totemism, growing more pronounced
as we go eastward, and culminating in Fiji, in which
totemic features are very rare.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_478" id="p_478">478</a></b>. In the Bismarck Archipelago every class has connected
with it certain animals regarded as relatives, but in New Britain,
apparently, not as ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> In New Ireland dances imitating the
movements of the sacred animals are performed. Such animals are
treated with great respect, and the relation to them constitutes a
bond of union between members of a class.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_479" id="p_479">479</a></b>. Some peculiarities appear in the Solomon Islands. While
there is the usual regard for the sacred objects (called <i>buto</i>), so that
these are not to be eaten (in some cases not to be touched or seen),
the names of the classes are not always those of the sacred things,
and there is difference of opinion among the natives as to whether
the latter are ancestors or merely associated with an ancestor: a
man (particularly a chief) may announce that after death he will
be incarnate in a given thing, as, for example, a banana&mdash;this
then becomes sacred. But in some cases<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> the god of the class is
regarded as the ancestor; instead of a number of sacred animals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>there is a theistic system with regular worship&mdash;a state of things
quite distinct from totemism.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_480" id="p_480">480</a></b>. In the New Hebrides group there is mention of a slight
magical ceremony performed by a member of a class to attract a
class animal, but there is no rule against eating the object whose
name the class bears. The usage in the Santa Cruz group in regard
to eating, and the belief as to descent from the sacred object,
differ in different islands; they are sometimes lax and vague, sometimes
strict and definite.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_481" id="p_481">481</a></b>. Belief in a vital connection between a man and some object
chosen by himself is found in the Banks Islands; there is an obvious
similarity between such an object and the North American manitu.
Further, the belief is reported by Rivers that in these islands the
character of a child is determined by an edible object from which
the mother, before the birth of the child, received some sort of
influence; the child will resemble the object or be identified with
it, and will not, throughout life, eat of it.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_482" id="p_482">482</a></b>. In the easternmost group, the Fijian, the relation between
the tribes and their associated sacred animals and plants was, and
is, various. The rule was that these should not be injured, and, if
edible, should not be eaten. But alongside of such sacred objects
real gods are found; these dwell or are incarnate in certain birds,
fish, and plants, and sometimes in men. In one district, in the interior
of the large island Viti Levu, Rivers learned that every village
had its deity, which in many cases might turn into an animal, and
the animal would then become taboo;<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> the familiar custom of not
eating a sacred thing was thus extended to any new object of this
sort. The functions of the tribal sacred animals approached in
some points those of gods: they were consulted by magicians on
important occasions (war, sickness, marriage). It was supposed
(somewhat as in the Banks Islands) that the tribal sacred animal
appeared to a mother just before the birth of her child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span><b><a name="p_483" id="p_483">483</a></b>. Thus in Melanesia, along with a large mass of sacred objects
connected more or less intimately with social units (but not
with clans proper), there are usages and ideas that are commonly
found associated with clan totemism (belief in descent from a sacred
thing and refusal to eat it when it is edible), but also other ideas
and usages (omens from animals; superhuman determination, before
a child's birth, of its character; creation of a new sacred thing by
an individual man) that look away from clan organization to an
individualistic form of society.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_484" id="p_484">484</a></b>. <i>Micronesia and Polynesia.</i> The character of the social
organization in Micronesia (the Caroline and Pelew groups, with
which may be included the little island of Tikopia, southeast of
the Santa Cruz group) is not very well known, but the published
reports indicate a considerable divergence from clan totemism. The
westernmost island of the Carolines, Uap (or Yap), according to a
recent observer,<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> retains many old beliefs, is without an exogamous
system, and has a large apparatus of spirits and gods. Elsewhere
in the Carolines and in Tikopia there are non-exogamous social
groups, sacred animals greatly revered, and in some places belief
in descent from an animal-god. Sacred animals and village gods
(with exogamous families) are found in the Pelew group.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> The
diversity in Micronesian customs may be due in part to mixture
of tribes resulting from migrations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_485" id="p_485">485</a></b>. In Polynesia the family is generally the social unit, and there
is a fairly good political organization, with more or less developed
pantheons. Gods are held to be incarnate in animals and trees,
but there are also great gods divorced to some extent from phenomena.
The theistic development is noteworthy in Hawaii, New
Zealand, Samoa, Tahiti, and Tonga, and there are elaborate forms
of worship with priests and temples. The existing organization is
not totemic, but here, as elsewhere in similar cases, the question
has been raised whether or not the gods have arisen from sacred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>(or, more definitely, totemic) animals and plants,<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> and whether, in
general, the existing organization was preceded by one approaching
totemism.<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_486" id="p_486">486</a></b>. <i>Indonesia.</i> The Battas of the interior of Sumatra have clan
exogamy (but the clans live mixed together), and every clan has
sacred animals which it is unlawful to eat. One clan on the west
coast asserts its descent from a tiger. In the Moluccas villages
claim descent from animals or plants, and these are taboo. The
indications of totemic organization in Borneo are slight: there are
sacred animals that are not eaten, and there is a vague feeling of
kinship with animals&mdash;phenomena that are not necessarily totemic.
The belief of the Sea Dyaks in individual guardians is to be distinguished
from general respect for sacred animals.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_487" id="p_487">487</a></b>. <i>India.</i> The non-Aryan peoples of India are divided into
a large number of exogamous clans, each with its sacred object,
which it is unlawful to injure or use.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> A departure from ordinary
totemic usage appears in the fact that in many cases the sacred
objects receive worship. The social constitution of these peoples
seems to have undergone modifications, partly through adoption of
agriculture (which has occurred generally), partly by direct Hindu
religious influence; the history of the non-Aryans, however, is obscure
in many points. The Aryans of India have exogamy but not
totemism, and this is true in part of the Assamese. Totemism has
not been observed in Burma<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> and China, or in the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_488" id="p_488">488</a></b>. <i>North America.</i> The North American native tribes, scattered
over a large territory, with widely different climatic and
topographical features, and themselves divided into half a dozen linguistic
stocks, show great diversities of social organization. While
exogamous groups (clans, phratries, and local groups) are found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>almost everywhere, there is little precise information about certain
fundamental points of totemic systems, particularly customs of killing
and eating the totem and belief in descent from it. With a
general apparatus that often suggests an original totemism, the
American social type differs considerably from the Australian, resembling
in some respects the Melanesian and the Polynesian, but
with peculiarities that difference it from these. Among the Eskimo
and the Californians no definite signs of totemism have been discovered.
Among the other peoples the Rocky Mountain range
makes a line of demarcation&mdash;the tribes of the Pacific Coast differ
in organization decidedly not only from their eastern neighbors
but also from all other known savage and half-civilized peoples.
There are points of similarity to these, but the general Pacific
Coast type is unique.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_489" id="p_489">489</a></b>. Beginning with the <i>Eastern</i> tribes, we find that the Iroquois
and their allies (Mohawks, Senecas, and others),<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> mainly agricultural,
had the tribe or the phratry rather than the clan as their political
and religious unit. The Iroquois League, organized by the great
statesman Hiawatha in the fifteenth century, was a federal union
of five (later of six) tribes that showed remarkable political wisdom
and skill. The great festivals were tribal. The clan is recognized
in a myth that describes the metamorphosis of a turtle into a man
who became the progenitor of the clan of that name, and it was
socially influential by reason of the brotherhood that existed among
members of clans having the same name in different tribes, and
through the fact that a man's personal name was the property of
the clan. The totem figure was used as a badge. Whether or not
the totem was killed and eaten is not known. In the form, then,
in which it is known, the Iroquois organization cannot be called
totemic&mdash;whether it was originally such must be left undetermined.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_490" id="p_490">490</a></b>. The Cherokees, belonging to the southern division of the
Iroquois stock (living formerly in Tennessee and North Carolina),
killed the animals they respected, but with ceremonies. Their Green
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>Corn dance, the object of which was to insure a good crop, was
expiatory, and was accompanied by a general amnesty.<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_491" id="p_491">491</a></b>. Wyandot (Huron) myths<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> account for their Snake and
Hawk clans by stories of marriages between women and a snake
or a hawk; here human beings are assumed to have existed before
the genesis of the clan (a difference from the Australian scheme),
but it is true that the clan is held to have descended in part from
an animal.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_492" id="p_492">492</a></b>. In the great Algonkin stock<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> the evidence for a distinct
totemic organization is similarly indefinite. The Len&acirc;p&eacute; (Delawares),
who were agricultural and well advanced in manufacture,
gave prominence to families rather than to clans, and the totem was
a badge. The Ojibwas, hunters (dwelling by the Great Lakes and
in the valley of the St. Lawrence),<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> also used their sacred animal
forms as badges; whether they ate such animals or claimed descent
from them we are not informed. The friendly relation existing
between the Otter and Beaver clans is explained by a story of a
marriage between an Otter clansman and a Beaver woman. For
the Potawatamies it was lawful to kill and eat the totem. The
Ottawas (of Canada) and the combined Sauks and Foxes (of the
Mississippi Valley) had traditions of descent from the totem. The
Menomini (of the same region) would kill the totem, but always
with an apology to it; their myths embody varying conceptions of
the relation of eponymous animals to clans: sometimes the origin
of a clan is referred to the action of a supernatural being who
changed a bear, for example, into a man, or to adventures of
animals; sometimes eponymous birds (eagle and hawk) are described
as being spirits or deities. Such introduction of supernatural
beings involves a deviation from the conception of the
eponymous animal as independent creator of a clan.<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span><b><a name="p_493" id="p_493">493</a></b>. For the tribes bordering on the Gulf of Mexico no signs
have been preserved of an organization based on the relation
between clans and eponymous animals, plants, and other objects.
The great Maskoki stock (including Creeks, Seminoles, Choctaws,
Chickasas, and some other less important tribes) had a well-formed
political system, and their religion was represented by the Chief
Magician or Priest (Medicine Man). They performed magical
ceremonies for increase of food, but these were tribal, and the
Creek annual fast (<i>puskita</i>, busk) had high religious and ethical
significance.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_494" id="p_494">494</a></b>. The Caddoan group, dwelling formerly west of the Mississippi,
in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, had an approach to
specific totemism. In the Caddo tribe clansmen refrained from
killing the eponymous animal; but all members of the tribe refrained
from killing eagles and panthers. Whether this custom
represents former clan restrictions is uncertain. For the related
Skidi Pawnee (who formerly dwelt in the Nebraska region) there
is evidence, from folk-tales, of a belief in the origin of clans from
marriages between human beings and animals, and of belief that
through such marriages benefits accrued to the people. But such
beliefs appear not to have affected the Pawnee social organization.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_495" id="p_495">495</a></b>. The Nakchi (Natchez) people (of the lower Mississippi
Valley) dwelt in villages that had such names as "pond-lily people,"
"hickory people," "swan people," "forest people." These are possibly
survivals of totemic names, but there is no account of the
existence of totemic groups among them. On the other hand,
they had a highly developed sun-worship, with human sacrifices.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_496" id="p_496">496</a></b>. Customs in the Siouan stock vary. In the Dakota tribe
there is no known evidence of totemism. The Omahas (of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>Missouri Valley), who are partly agriculturalists, partly hunters,
refrain from eating or using eponymous objects, certain clans are
credited with magical power over such objects, and there are traces,
in ceremonies and myths, of the descent of clans, each from its
eponym. This combination of more definite totemistic conceptions
is not found in any other member of the Siouan stock. The Osages
had a tradition or myth of their descent from animals, but their
civil organization was nontotemic&mdash;they were divided into two
groups, termed respectively the Peace Side and the War Side, and
the members of the former group took no animal life, though they
ate flesh that they obtained from the War Side. The origin of this
custom is uncertain&mdash;the two divisions of the tribe, the hunters
and the tillers of the soil, exchanged products, but how this division
of labor arose (whether from a union of two tribes or otherwise)
is not clear. Among the Hidatsa, it is reported, there was a belief
that spirit children might enter into a woman and be born into the
world. The resemblance to the Central Australian belief is striking,
but it does not appear that such entrance of spirit children was
supposed to be the only mode of human birth. The Mandans (living
on the Missouri River, in North Dakota) now have no totemic
system; but little or nothing is known of their early history.<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> In
the Siouan tribes the figure of the individual animal guardian (the
manitu or "medicine") plays a prominent r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_497" id="p_497">497</a></b>. There are indications that the institutions of the Pueblo
tribes (who are now wholly agricultural) have undergone modifications,
perhaps under foreign (Spanish) influence. Hopi myths
represent clans as descended from ancestors originally animal, and
transformed into human shape by deities. But the elaborate sun-worship
and the complicated solstice ceremonies are tribal.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> The
Zu&ntilde;i economic ceremonies appear to have passed from under clan
control. Thus, the magical ceremony for procuring rain, properly
the function of the Frog clan, is now in the hands of rain-priests;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>and the magical, dramatic performances for insuring a supply of
food are conducted by nontotemic religious fraternities. The great
Snake "dance" may have been originally a totemic ceremony intended
to secure rain and corn.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_498" id="p_498">498</a></b>. For a former totemic organization among the Navahos,
Apaches, and Mohaves (these last live on the Colorado River)
there are only vague traditions and other faint traces; the taboos
on foods now touch not a particular clan but a whole tribe.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_499" id="p_499">499</a></b>. The coast tribes of Northwest America (in British Columbia
and the United States)<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> differ in social organization from the other
Indians in several respects, and particularly in the importance they
attach to rank, in their employment of the crest or badge, and in
the prominence they give to the individual guardian animal or spirit.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_500" id="p_500">500</a></b>. In the civil organization of the Carrier division of the D&eacute;n&eacute;,
the Salish, the Kwakiutl, and other tribes, three or four castes or
groups are recognized: hereditary nobles; the middle class, whose
position is based on property; and the common folk; and to these
is to be added among some tribes the class of slaves. In the
summer ceremonies the men are seated according to class and
rank. The family pride of the nobles is great&mdash;every family has
its traditions and pedigrees. In such a scheme the zo&ouml;nymous clan
plays an insignificant part. Classes and clans are mixed in the
villages in which, for the most part, these people live, and trade
is prominent in their life. The curious custom of the "potlatch"&mdash;a
man invites his friends and neighbors to a gathering and
makes them magnificent presents, his reputation being great in
proportion to the extent of his gifts&mdash;appears to be a device for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>laying up property; the host in his turn receives presents from
friends and neighbors.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_501" id="p_501">501</a></b>. The employment of a sacred object as a badge or crest, a
sign of tribal or clan position, is found, as is noted above,<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> in various
parts of the world: in the Torres Straits islands, in the Aru archipelago
(west of New Guinea), and in North America among the
Iroquois, the Len&acirc;p&eacute; (Delawares), the Pueblos, and perhaps among
the Potawatamies. In these tribes, however, the r&ocirc;le of the badge
is relatively unimportant&mdash;it is employed for decorative purposes,
but does not enter fundamentally into the organization of the clan
or the tribe. In Northwest America, on the other hand, it is of
prime significance both in decoration and in organization&mdash;it, to
a great extent, takes the place occupied elsewhere by the totem,
and it is not always identical with the eponymous object of the
clan, though this may be an accidental result of shifting social
relations (new combinations of clans, or a borrowing of a device
from a neighbor).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_502" id="p_502">502</a></b>. <i>The crest.</i> The origin of this function of the crest and its
relation to the function of the totem is not clear; it may have
arisen in different ways in different places, or different conceptions
may have been combined in the same place. The decorative use
is an independent fact, having no necessary connection with clan
organization; the demand for decoration is universal among savages,
and the employment of sacred objects for this purpose is natural.
Figures of such objects are used, however, in magical procedures&mdash;abundantly,
for example, in Central Australia&mdash;and it is conceivable
that such use by a clan may have converted the totemic object
into a symbol or device. The artistic employment of figures of
sacred objects has been developed on the American Pacific Coast
to a remarkable extent; the great poles standing in front of houses
or erected in memory of the dead have carved on them histories
of the relation of the family or of the deceased person to certain animals
and events. These so-called totem poles presuppose, it is true,
reverence for the sacred symbol, but the custom may possibly have
grown simply out of artistic and historical (or biographical) motives.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_503" id="p_503">503</a></b>. Perhaps, however, we must assume or include another line
of development. The crest may be regarded either as the non-artistic
modification or degradation of an original true totem (due
to diminished reverence for animals and other causes), or as an
employment of sacred objects (for purposes of organization) that
has not reached the proportions of totemism proper. Which of
these views will seem the more probable will depend partly on
the degree of importance assigned to certain traditions and folk-stories
of the Northwestern tribes, partly on one's construction
of the general history of totemistic observances. In so obscure a
subject a definite theory can hardly be maintained. The large
number of stories in which the beginnings of clan life are attributed
to marriages between clansmen and eponymous animals, or
to beneficent or other adventures with such animals, may appear
to indicate that there was an underlying belief in the descent of
clans from animals. On the other hand, in certain low tribes (in
New Britain and the Solomon Islands and elsewhere) the feeling
of kinship with animals is said to exist without the belief that they
are ancestors, or the animal is regarded as the representative of a
human ancestor rather than as itself the ancestor. This latter view
may be a bit of euhemeristic rationalism.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_504" id="p_504">504</a></b>. While <i>guardian spirits</i> (generally in animal form) are found
abundantly in America and elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> their r&ocirc;le in the tribes of
the Pacific Coast appears to be specially important, for there they
largely take the place occupied in Central Australia by the clan
totems. They are not wholly lacking, however, in Australia. Among
the nontotemic Kurnai of Southeast Australia there are animal
patrons of the sexes and of shamans and other individuals. In like
manner the shamans of the Pacific Coast Haidas and Tlingit have
their guardians, and sometimes secret societies are similarly provided;
in the winter ceremonies of the Kwakiutl the youth is supposed
to be possessed by the patron of the society to which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>belongs. We thus have, apparently, similar and mutually independent
developments in Australia and America out of the early
relations of men with animals.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_505" id="p_505">505</a></b>. The Eskimo live in small groups, and marriage is locally
unrestricted. There is the usual reverence for animals, with folk-stories
of animal creators and of transformations, but no well-defined
marks of totemism, and no recognition of individual protecting
animal-spirits.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_506" id="p_506">506</a></b>. In the Californian tribes, which are among the least developed
in America, no traces of totemistic organization have been
found.<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> The people live, or lived, in villages. The shamans, who
are important members of the communities, have their familiar
spirits, acquired through dreams and by ascetic observances; but
these belong to the widespread apparatus of magic, and differ in
their social function from guardian spirits proper.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_507" id="p_507">507</a></b>. There are no definite marks of totemism in Central and
Northeastern Asia, and few such marks in Africa. The Siberian
Koryaks believe in a reincarnation of deceased human beings in
animals, but their social organization is not determined by this
belief. Certain clans of the Ainu (inhabiting the northernmost
islands of the Japan archipelago) are said to regard as ancestors
the animals whose names they bear, but this belief appears to be
socially unimportant. Marriage is not controlled by clan relations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_508" id="p_508">508</a></b>. Throughout savage Africa sacred animals, plants, and other
objects play a great part in life, but generally without assuming a
specifically totemistic r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_509" id="p_509">509</a></b>. In the great Bantu family the usages vary greatly.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> One
of the most interesting systems is that of the Bakuana (in the south).
Here the eponymous animal approaches divinity&mdash;not only is
it killed with regret, it is a thing to swear by, and has magical
power; but independence of the totem appears in the fact that it
may be changed; that is, it is a friend adopted by men at their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>convenience. It is in accord with this conception that the Bakuana
(who are pastoral and agricultural) have clan gods. Beyond taboos
on sacred objects there is nothing in the Bantu territory that
clearly indicates a totemistic organization of society.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_510" id="p_510">510</a></b>. In the half-civilized and higher savage communities of the
eastern and western parts of the continent totemism proper, if it
has ever been predominant, has been expelled or depressed by
higher forms of organization. It seems not to exist among the
Masai, a vigorous people with an interesting theistic system. The
neighboring Nandi, who have clan totems, lay stress rather on the
family than on the clan in their marriage laws, and their taboos
include more than their totems; their excessive regard for the
hyena may be due simply to their fear of the animal.<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_511" id="p_511">511</a></b>. The half-civilized Baganda (of the British Uganda Protectorate)
refrain from injuring clan totems, but the functions of the
clans are now political and religious (relating, for example, to the
building of temples) under the control of a quasi-royal government;
there is almost complete absence of magical ceremonies
for the multiplication or control of sacred objects.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> Old marriage
laws are relaxed&mdash;a king may marry his sister (as in ancient
Egypt). Free dealing with totems is illustrated by the adoption of
a new cooking-pot as totem by one clan. The cult of the python
obtains here, as in West Africa. Among the neighboring Banyoro,
and among the Bahima (west of Victoria Nyanza), who are herdsmen
with a kingly government, there is the usual reverence for
animals, but eponymous animals are not important for the social
organization.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_512" id="p_512">512</a></b>. In West Africa also definite totemistic organization has
not been found. Everywhere there is reverence for the eponymous
sacred thing, and, when it is edible, refusal to eat it; but the
taboos are sometimes, as in Siena (which is agricultural), more extensive
than the list of sacred things. In Southern Nigeria at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>funerals (and sometimes on other occasions) the totem animal or
plant is offered, in the form of soup, to the dead; the animal or
plant in such cases is regarded, apparently, simply or mainly as
acceptable food for ghosts&mdash;the offering is a part of ancestor-worship.
In Congo families have sacred animals (as in Samoa)
which they abstain from eating. Here and there occurs belief in
the reincarnation of deceased human beings in animals. A negro
fetish, becoming intimately associated with a clan, sometimes resembles
a totem. The half-civilized Ashanti, Dahomi, and Yoruba
have elaborate theistic systems, with monarchical governments
that leave no place for a totemistic organization.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_513" id="p_513">513</a></b>. Madagascar, before it came under European control, had
a well-defined religious and political hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> Along with its
very elaborate tabooism the island has beliefs concerning animals
that are found in totemic systems but do not take the form of
totemism proper. The animal is regarded as an ancestor or a patron,
but clans do not take their names from animals, there is no general
rule of exogamy, and there is no word corresponding exactly to
the word 'totem.' The question arises whether the Malagasy system
is a stage antecedent to totemism proper or an attenuated
survival of it.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_514" id="p_514">514</a></b>. <i>Alleged survivals of totemism among civilized peoples.</i>
Though totemism, as a system of social organization, is not recognizable
in any civilized community, ancient or modern, it is held
by some scholars that the fragments or hints of such a system
that are certified bear witness to its former existence in these
communities.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span><b><a name="p_515" id="p_515">515</a></b>. In fact certain ideas and customs that occur in connection
with savage totemism are found abundantly among ancient Semites,
Greeks and Romans, and in Celtic and Teutonic lands. They are
such as the following: a tribe or clan bears an animal name, and
regards itself as akin to the animal in question and as descended
from it; this animal is sacred, not to be killed or eaten (except
ceremonially), and, when it dies, is to be buried solemnly; sacred
animals aid men by furnishing omens, or even by protecting from
harm; they are sacrificed on critical occasions (sometimes once
every year), and in some cases the killing of the sacrificial animal
is treated as a crime; animal-gods are worshiped, and gods are
thought to be incarnate in animals; men change into animals and
animals into men; certain animals are sacred to certain deities;
human worshipers dress in imitation of animal forms (by wearing
skins of beasts and by other devices); a man's tribal mark is
derived from the form of an animal; the death of the sacrificial
animal comes to be regarded as the death of a god; the form of
social organization in certain ancient communities is similar to that
with which totemism is usually found associated.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_516" id="p_516">516</a></b>. Not all of these points are found in any one case, but their
occurrence over so wide an area, it is argued, is most naturally
explicable by the assumption of an original totemism of which
these are the survivals. It is suggested also that they may be an
inheritance from savage predecessors of the civilized peoples.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_517" id="p_517">517</a></b>. It will be sufficient to mention a few examples of the beliefs
and usages that appear to point to an original totemism.<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> Names
of clans and tribes derived from animals or plants are not uncommon:
Hebrew Ra&#7723;el (Rachel, ewe), perhaps Kaleb (dog) and
Yael (Jael, mountain goat);<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> Greek Kunnadai (dog), and perhaps
Myrmidon (ant); Roman Porcius (hog), Fabius (bean); Irish
Coneely (seal); Teutonic clan-names like Wolfing and the like.
Belief in a general kinship of men and animals existed among
Semites, Greeks, and Romans. On the other hand, belief in the
descent of a clan from an animal rarely appears: it is apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>not found in the Semitic area; the Ophiogeneis of Parium (in Asia
Minor) are said to have regarded themselves as akin to snakes and to
have traced their genos (family or clan) to a hero who was at first
a snake;<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> the Myrmidons, according to one tradition, were transformed
ants, and some of the Irish Coneely clan are said to have
been changed into seals. Transformations of men into animals are
common in Greek mythology. Taboos of certain foods were observed
abundantly in the ancient world: by Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> Hebrews,<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a>
Greeks,<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> and Romans,<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> and by Celts.<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> Among the various omen-giving
animals some may have been totems. Solemn annual sacrifices,
followed by mourning for the victims, were performed in
Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> and the slaying of the sacrificial animal was treated as
murder in various Greek cities.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> Living animals were worshiped in
Egypt, and everywhere in antiquity gods assumed animal forms, and
certain animals were sacred to certain gods. Worshipers clothed
themselves in the skins of sacrificed animals in Egypt, Cyprus, and
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> Tribal marks and ensigns were sometimes derived from
figures of animals.<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> Finally, there are traces, in the early history
of the ancient civilized peoples, of the form of social organization
with which savage totemism is found associated.<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_518" id="p_518">518</a></b>. It is possible that such facts as these may point to a
primitive totemistic stage of ancient civilized society. But it is to
be noted that the usages in question almost all relate to the general
sacredness of animals (or of plants), not to their specific character
as totems. They occur in lower tribes in cases where totemism does
not exist.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> Animal clan-names and tribe-names, belief in kinship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>with animals and plants and in descent from them, exogamy,
transformations, refusal to eat certain animals except ceremonially,
apologies for killing them, omens derived from them, worship of
animal-gods, incarnations of gods in animals, animals sacred to
gods, tribal marks derived from animals&mdash;all these are found in
such diverse social combinations that it is impossible to infer merely
from the occurrence of this or that custom the existence of the
peculiar form of social organization to which the name 'totemism'
proper is given above. The same remark holds of inferences from
the general constitution of early society; a custom of matrilineal
descent, for example, by no means carries totemism with it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_519" id="p_519">519</a></b>. The evidence for the existence of totemism among the ancient
civilized peoples, consisting, as it does, of detached statements of
customs that are found elsewhere without totemism, is not decisive.
Animal-worship has played a great r&ocirc;le in religious history, but the
special part assigned to totemism has often been exaggerated. It has
been held that the latter is at the base of all beliefs in the sacredness
of animals and plants, or that certain usages (such as those mentioned
above) are inexplicable except on the supposition of an original
totemism. These positions are not justified by known facts, and
it will conduce to clearness to give totemism its distinct place in that
general regard for animals and plants of which it is a peculiar part.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_520" id="p_520">520</a></b>. Totemistic forms of society, as far as our present knowledge
goes, are found only among the lower peoples, and among
these a perplexing variety of conditions exists. As our review of
what may be called totemistic features shows,<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> the one permanent
element in the relation between men and nonhuman, nondivine
objects is reverence for these last on men's part; and the conception
of an alliance, defensive and offensive, between the two
groups has been proposed above as an additional differentia of
totemism, a sense of kinship being involved. If we further add the
condition that the social organization (not necessarily exogamous)
must be determined by this alliance, we have all that can safely be
demanded in a definition of totemism; but as much as this seems
necessary if totemism is to be marked off as a definite institution.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_521" id="p_521">521</a></b>. From the point of view of religious history the important
thing in any social organization is its character as framework for
religious ideas and customs. If the central social fact is an intimate
relation between a human group and a nonhuman class of natural
objects, then conceptions regarding this relation may gather about
it, and these will be as various as the tribes of men. The elements
of social and religious institutions spring from the universal human
nature and attach themselves to any form of life that may have
been suggested by circumstances. Thus the term 'totemism' may
be used loosely to denote any combination of customs connected
with the idea of an alliance between man and other things, and
the alliance itself may exist in various degrees of intimacy. The
restricted definition suggested above is in part arbitrary, but it
may serve as a working hypothesis and as a norm by which to
estimate and define the various systems or cults involving a relation
between human groups and individuals on the one side and
nonhuman things on the other side.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_522" id="p_522">522</a></b>. <i>Conditions favorable and unfavorable to totemistic organization.</i>
The questions whether totemism was the earliest form of
human social life and whether existing freer forms are developments
out of definite totemism may be left undetermined. Data for the
construction of primitive life are not accessible, and how far decay
or decadence of institutions is to be recognized must be determined
in every case from such considerations as are offered by the circumstances.
We may, however, distinguish between social conditions
in connection with which some sort of totemism flourishes and
those under which it is nonexistent or feeble; we may thus note
unfavorable and, by contrast, favorable general accompaniments.
These may be roughly described as economic, individualistic, political,
and religious.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_523" id="p_523">523</a></b>. <i>Economic conditions.</i> Of savage and slightly civilized tribes
some live by hunting or fishing, some are pastoral (nomadic or
settled), some practice agriculture. Without undertaking to trace
minutely the history of these economic practices it may be assumed
that they are fixed in general by climatic and topographical conditions.
Where food is plentiful, thought and life are likely to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
freer. In general, savage peoples are constantly on the alert to
discover supplies of food, and they show ingenuity in devising economic
methods&mdash;when one resource fails they look for another.
Hunters and fishers are dependent on wild animals for food, and
stand in awe of them. The domestication of animals leads men to
regard them simply as material for the maintenance of life&mdash;the
mystery that once attached to them vanishes; they are considered
not as man's equals or superiors but as his servants. The same result
follows when they are used as aids in tilling the soil or in transportation.
Agricultural peoples also have generally some knowledge
of the arts of life and a somewhat settled civil and political organization,
and these tend to separate them from the lower animals and
to diminish or destroy their sense of kinship with them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_524" id="p_524">524</a></b>. We find, in fact, that in many cases totemic regulations are
less strict where the food supply is plentiful and where agriculture
is practiced. The correspondence is not exact&mdash;other considerations
come in, such as isolation and the unknown quantity of natural
tribal endowments; but the relation between the economic and
totemic conditions is so widespread that it cannot be considered
as accidental.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_525" id="p_525">525</a></b>. Thus, for example, the contrast between the social system
of sterile Central Australia and that of certain tribes on the comparatively
fertile southeast coast is marked; the Kurnai have practically
no clan totemism. In the islands of Torres Straits and in New
Guinea agriculture marks a dividing line between stricter and
looser organizations based on regard for the totem. The agricultural
Melanesian and Polynesian tribes, with great regard for animal
patrons, lay stress on the family or on voluntary associations rather
than on the clan. In Africa the partially civilized peoples, such as
the Baganda and adjacent tribes in the east, and Yoruba, Dahomi,
and Ashanti in the west, have fairly well-developed religious organizations,
in which totems play a subordinate part. The customs of
certain tribes in the south are especially worthy of note: the pastoral
Herrero have a double system of clans, maternal and paternal,
and their food restrictions are curiously minute, relating to parts
of animals or to their color; the Bakuana, who are pastoral and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
agricultural, kill the clan eponymous animals, though unwillingly,
and appear not to regard them as ancestors. The non-Aryan tribes
of India have been so long in contact with Aryan civilization that
in many cases, as it seems, their original customs have been obscured,
but at present among such agricultural tribes as the Hos,
the Santhals, and the Khonds of Bengal, and some others, totemic
organizations are not prominent, and the Todas, with their buffalo-cult,
show no signs of totemism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_526" id="p_526">526</a></b>. In North America the variety of climatic and other economic
conditions might lead us to expect clear testimony as to the
relation between these conditions and totemic development; but
the value of such testimony is impaired by the absence of information
concerning early forms of organization. In the period
for which there are details it appears that in the Eastern groups
(Iroquois, Algonkin, Creek, Natchez, Siouan, Pueblo) the effective
r&ocirc;le of totemism is in inverse proportion to the development of
agriculture and to stable civil organization: there are clans bearing
the names of animals and other objects, with mythical stories of
descent from such objects, and rules of exogamy, but the civil,
political, and religious life is largely independent of these conditions;
there are great confederations of tribes with well-devised
systems of government that look to the well-being of the whole
community, the clan-division being of small importance. The mode
of life appears to be determined or greatly influenced by climate,
though different climatic situations sometimes lead to similar results:
agriculture naturally arises from fertility of soil, but the
Pueblo tribes have been driven (perhaps under civilized influences),
by the aridness of their land, to till the soil. Throughout
the East the known facts suggest that a nontotemic organization
has followed an earlier form in which quasi-totemic elements are
recognizable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_527" id="p_527">527</a></b>. The interesting social organization of the Northern Pacific
Coast, on the other hand, appears to be independent of agriculture.
The people live by hunting and fishing; families and villages are
the important social units; instead of totems there are crests or
badges; society in some tribes is marked by a division into classes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
differing in social rank. The history of all these tribes, however, is
obscure: there have been modifications of organization through
the influence of some tribes on others; the details of the various
social schemes are not all accurately known. The settled village
life and the half-commercial, half-aristocratic constitution of society
must be referred to racial characteristics and other conditions with
which we are not acquainted. As in the East, so here there is the
suggestion of a movement away from a form of organization that
resembles true totemism. The Northwest has a remarkable system
of ceremonies, but in definiteness and elevation of religious conceptions
it is greatly inferior to the East.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_528" id="p_528">528</a></b>. The fact that some of the least-advanced American tribes,
particularly the Eskimo and the California tribes, show no signs
of totemistic organization<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> makes against the view that totemism
was the initial form of human society, but its historical background
is not known. In any case it does not invalidate what is said above
of the r&ocirc;le of agriculture in the modification of savage institutions.
The lines of savage growth have been various&mdash;a general law of
development cannot be laid down; the history of every community
must be studied for itself, and its testimony must be given its
appropriate value. In this way it will be possible to give a sketch
of totemistic forms and suggestions, if not a history of totemism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_529" id="p_529">529</a></b>. <i>Individualistic institutions.</i> The development of individualism,
a universal accompaniment of general social progress, is
unfavorable to totemism, since in this latter the individual is subordinated
to the clan. To assert one's self as an individual is practically
to ignore the totem, whose function pertains to the clan as a
whole, without separate recognition of its members. Revolt against
the supremacy of the clan (if that expression is allowable) has shown
itself from an early social stage and in all parts of the world. The
principal forms in which it appears are the institution of voluntary
societies, and the adoption of personal guardians by individuals.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_530" id="p_530">530</a></b>. <i>Secret societies.</i> It is a common custom in the lower tribes
to keep the sexes separate and to distinguish between the initiated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>and the uninitiated. There are often men's houses in which the
young unmarried males are required to live.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> Women and boys
are forbidden to be present at ceremonies of initiation when, as
in some instances, the secrets of the tribe are involved. Thus there
arise frequently secret associations of males, who conduct tribal
affairs. But these associations are not voluntary&mdash;all initiated men
belong to them perforce&mdash;and they are not divorced from totemic
relations. The real voluntary society is of a quite different character.
In general, in its most developed form, it ignores differences of age,
sex, and clan. There are, however, diversities in the constitution
of the various organizations that may be called voluntary;<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> conditions
of membership and functions vary.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_531" id="p_531">531</a></b>. Such organizations are of two sorts, one mainly political
or governmental, the other mainly religious. The best examples
of the first sort are found in Melanesia, Polynesia, and West Africa.
The clan government by the old men, of which a simple form exists
in Central Australia, has passed into, or is represented by, a society
of men that undertakes to maintain order, exact contributions, and
provide amusements for the people. The Dukduk of the Bismarck
Archipelago,<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> the Egbo of Old Calabar, and the Ogboni of Yoruba,<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a>
to take prominent examples, are police associations that have managed
to get complete control of their respective communities and
have naturally become instruments of oppression and fraud. They
have elaborate ceremonies of initiation, are terrible to women and
uninitiated males, and religion usually enters only casually and subordinately
into their activities, chiefly in the form of magical ceremonies.
A partial exception, in regard to this last point, occurs in the
case of the Areoi society of Tahiti, which, as it is the best-organized
society in Polynesia, is also the most tyrannical, and the broadest in
its scope; its members enjoy not only a large share of the good things
of this life, but also the most desirable positions in the future life.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span><b><a name="p_532" id="p_532">532</a></b>. On the other hand, the North American voluntary societies
are mainly concerned with the presentation of religious ideas by
the dramatization of myths, and by demanding for membership
some sort of religious experience. How far such societies existed
in the Eastern tribes it is not possible to say. Among these tribes,
as among the Skidi Pawnee, the Navahos, and other groups of the
Middle West, the control of religion has largely passed into the hands
of priests&mdash;an advance in religious organization. Where ceremonies
are conducted by societies, membership in these is often conditioned
on the adoption of a personal divine patron by every member.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_533" id="p_533">533</a></b>. This adoption of a <i>guardian spirit</i> by the individual is the
most definite early divergence from the totemistic clan organization.
An intermediate stage is represented by the sex-patrons of Southeast
Australia,<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> who embody a declaration of independence by the
women. In this region, moreover, among the Kurnai, not only
shamans but all other men have each his special "brother" and protector.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a>
Naturally, where the family, in distinction from the clan,
is the social unit, family protectors arise. The Koryaks of Northeastern
Asia have a guardian spirit for every family and also for
every person.<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> A curious feature of Dahomi religion is the importance
that is attached to the family ghost as protector, the ghost,
that is, of a former member of the family, ordinarily its head; he
has a shrine, and becomes practically an inferior deity. Still more
remarkable is the worship that the West African native, both on the
Gold Coast and on the Slave Coast (communities with well-developed
systems of royal government), offers to his own indwelling spirit;<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a>
the man's birthday is sacred to the spirit and is commenced with
a sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> In Samoa a guardian spirit (conceived of as incarnate
in some animal) is selected for a child at its birth.<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> Some such
custom is said to exist among the Eskimo of the Yukon district
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>in Alaska; a guardian animal is selected by a boy when he arrives
at the age of puberty, or it is selected for him in his early childhood
by his parents.<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_534" id="p_534">534</a></b>. While these examples indicate a tendency toward the adoption
of individual patrons, and may suggest that the custom is, or
was, more widespread than now appears, it is among the North
American Redmen that this sort of individualism is best developed
and most effective socially and religiously.<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> There are traces of it
in the Eastern tribes; but it is in its Western form that it is best
known&mdash;it is explicit among the Western Algonkins and the Siouan
tribes, and on the Northwest Pacific Coast. Most men, though not
all, seek and obtain a guardian spirit (usually represented by an
animal) which shall protect from injury and bestow prowess in
war, success in love, and all other goods of life. The spirit is, as
a rule, independent of the clan totem&mdash;is found, indeed, in nontotemic
tribes; it is often identical with the eponymous animal of
some religious society. It is sometimes inherited, but rarely&mdash;the
essence of the institution is that the guardian shall be sought and
found. The preparation for the quest is by fasting; the revelation
of the guardian comes in a dream or a vision, or by some strong
impression made otherwise on the mind.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_535" id="p_535">535</a></b>. Among the Siouan Indians there are religious societies,
each of which bears the name of some animal and has a ritual
composed of chants and songs which, it is often claimed, have
been received in a supernatural manner.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> The youth who aspires
to become a member of one of these societies goes off alone to the
forest, and there, fasting and meditating, waits for the vision of
the sign. This comes usually in the form of an animal, and the
youth enters the society whose distinguishing mark this animal is.
First, however, he must travel until he meets the animal he saw,
when he must slay it and preserve the whole or a part of it. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>trophy is the sign of his vision and is the most sacred thing he can
possess, marking as it does his personal relation to the supernatural
being who has appeared to him.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_536" id="p_536">536</a></b>. A similar ceremony is found among the Kwakiutl in Northwestern
America.<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> The novice is supposed to stay some time with
the supernatural being who is the protector of his society. From this
interview he returns in a state of ecstasy, and is brought to a normal
state by the songs and dances and magical performances of
the shaman; but before he is permitted to take part in the ordinary
pursuits of life he must undergo a ceremonial purification. In these
tribes, as is remarked above, the totemic groups have been replaced
by clans, and in the winter ceremonial these clans (according to one
report) are again replaced by the secret societies, whose function
is political only in the sense that its members form a part of the
aristocracy. Recently societies of women have been established&mdash;a
fact that illustrates the divergence of the new system from the old.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_537" id="p_537">537</a></b>. The details of initiation or of acquisition of the guardian
spirit vary (for example, it is not always required that the youth
kill his patron animal), but in all cases there is recognition of the
emotional independence of the individual, and there is involved a
certain largeness of religious experience in the modern sense of the
term. The demand for the supernatural friend represents a germinal
desire for intimate personal relations with the divine world;
and, though the particular form that embodied the conception has
given way before more refined ideas, the conception itself has survived
in higher religions in the choice of patron saints.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_538" id="p_538">538</a></b>. <i>Political conditions.</i> Political organization, in unifying a
community under the control of a central authority, tends to efface
local self-governing groups. This process is visible in the increased
power of Melanesian chiefs, in the royal governments of Polynesia
and Western and Eastern Africa, and in the inchoate constitutional
federations of Eastern North America. In all these cases the simple
clan system is reduced to small proportions, and totemism loses its
social significance. The way in which the functions of totemic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>groups are thus modified appears plainly in such governmental
systems as that of the East African Baganda (in which heads of
clans have become officers of the king's household)<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> and the
Iroquois Confederation (in which the tribes act through their
representatives in a national Council or Parliament).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_539" id="p_539">539</a></b>. <i>Religious conditions.</i> The personal guardian spirit and the
totem, when it assumes this character, sometimes receive worship&mdash;they
are treated as gods. But their r&ocirc;le as divinities is of an
inferior nature, and it does not last long. Deities proper came into
existence as embodiments of the sense of an extrahuman government
of the world by anthropomorphic beings; they are direct
products of the constructive imagination.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> When the true gods
appear the totemic and individual half-gods disappear. We find
that totemism is feeble in proportion as theistic systems have taken
shape, and that where personal guardians are prominent there are
no well-defined gods. In Central Australia there is only a vague,
inactive form that may be called divine; a more definite conception
is found in Southeastern Australia, where the strictness of
totemism is relaxed. Melanesia and Polynesia show an increased
definiteness of theistic figures. Northwestern North America is,
in comparison with the East, undeveloped in this regard. Similar
relations between totemism and theism appear in India and South
America. In a certain number of cases the facts suggest that the
former system has been superseded by the latter.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_540" id="p_540">540</a></b>. Cults of the totem and of individual guardian spirits are
to be distinguished from certain other forms of worship with which
they have points of connection. The West African fetish is the
abode of a tutelary spirit, and finally is absorbed by local gods; it
arises, however, from belief in the sacredness and power of inanimate
things, and is without the sense of identity with the spirit that
characterizes the North American relation. The family sacred symbols
that are worshiped in some places<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> are really family gods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>(whether or not they were originally totems), developed, probably,
under Brahmanic influence. The worship of a tutelary spirit has
sometimes coalesced with that of an ancestor, but this is doubtless
due to the collocation of two distinct cults; at a certain stage an
ancestor is naturally regarded as friend and protector. The general
potency termed "mana" is not to be connected particularly with
any one cult; it represents a conception that probably underlies all
ancient forms of worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_541" id="p_541">541</a></b>. It thus appears that several lines of social progress have
proved unfavorable to totemism, and to these movements it has
generally succumbed. Its home has been, and is, in isolated hunting
communities; agriculture and social intercourse have been fatal to
it as to all early forms of society based on a belief in kinship with
nonhuman natural objects.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_542" id="p_542">542</a></b>. It remains to mention the principal theories of the origin
of totemism that are or have been held, and to ask what part it has
played in the history of religion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_543" id="p_543">543</a></b>. <i>Theories of the origin of totemism.</i> These may conveniently
be divided into such as refer the origin to individual action, and
such as refer it to the action of clans.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_544" id="p_544">544</a></b>. <i>Individualistic theories.</i> Among the earliest of theories were
those that explained the totemic constitution as due to a confusion
in the minds of savages between names and things. Individuals
or families might be named after animals, plants, and other
objects, and these, it was supposed, might come to be regarded as
intimately associated with human persons, and might be looked on
with affection or reverence and even worshiped.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> Or, more definitely,
it was held that, the origin of such names being forgotten,
reverence for the ancestors led to reverence for the things after
which they were named and identification with them&mdash;a man
whose ancestor was called "the Tiger" would think of himself as
descended from a tiger and as being of the tiger stock.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> It is now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>generally recognized, however, that the origin of so widespread and
influential a system of organization as totemism cannot be referred
to a mere misunderstanding of nicknames; and whether such misunderstanding
was general or natural in early times is open to doubt.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_545" id="p_545">545</a></b>. It sometimes happens that a man (generally a chief)
announces that after death he will take the form of this or that
animal or plant, and this procedure, it has been supposed, would
found a totemic family&mdash;his descendants would revere the object
in question as the embodiment of the spirit of the ancestor, would
take its name, and, when it was edible, would refrain from eating
it.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> It is true that the belief was, and is, not uncommon among
savages that a deceased person might take the form of some natural
object; but the reported cases are rare in which a man deliberately
enjoins on his descendants reverence for such an object with the
result that a quasi-totemic group arises.<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> This custom is not frequent
enough to account for totemism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_546" id="p_546">546</a></b>. A theory suggested by the fact that many clans perform
magical ceremonies (for the purpose of increasing the supply of
food) is that, when the magical apparatus of some body of persons
consisted of parts of an animal, the animal would become sacred,
a magical society might be formed by an individual magician, and
thus a totemic magic-working clan might be created. For this
hypothesis there is no support except in the fact that changes in
clan life are sometimes brought about by the old men; but such
changes are modifications of existing usages, not new creations.
The power of a savage man of genius may be admitted, but to
account for the known totemic communities we should have to
suppose a vast number of such men, in different parts of the world,
all working in the same direction and reaching substantially the
same results.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_547" id="p_547">547</a></b>. The belief that a man might deposit his soul in an animal
or a plant or some other object is found in West Africa, North
America, and probably elsewhere. As such objects would, as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>rule, not be killed (and every individual of a group would be thus
respected), it has been supposed that, when various persons deposited
their souls in the same object, a totemic body would come
into existence.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> This view would account for totemic reverence
and for the sense of kinship, but the objection to it is that in most
totemic organizations the belief in question has not been certified.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_548" id="p_548">548</a></b>. The "conceptional" theory refers the origin of totemism
to the belief, found among certain peoples, that conception is produced
by the entrance into the mother's womb of some object
(animal, plant, or other) with which the child is identified.<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> In Central
Australia it is held that what passes into the woman is a spirit
child which has a certain object for its totem; but in this case the
previous existence of the totem is assumed. In certain islands
(Mota and Motlav) of the Banks group, however, there exists, it
is said, the belief that a child is the object from which the mother
received some influence at conception or at some other period of
pregnancy&mdash;the child resembles the object, and may not eat it if
it is edible.<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> The persons thus identified with a given object would,
if united, constitute a group totemic in the respects that they believe
themselves to be one with the object in question and refrain
from eating it.<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> The totemic object is selected, in the case of every
child, by the fancy of the mother, and is, therefore, not inherited;
totemic groups, thus, would be found distributed through
the larger groups (phratries or tribes), and might also gradually
coalesce and form local groups. If the belief in this origin of birth
(identity of the child with some object) were found to be widespread,
and generally effective as the ground of early social organization,
it would furnish a satisfactory explanation of totemistic
beginnings. But in point of fact it has so far been found, in full
form, only in a small region in Melanesia, and its history in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>region is not known; back of it may lie some other system of
organization. And in this region clan totemism is lacking or faint.
Further testimony is needed before it can be accepted as the solution
of the problem of totemic origins.<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_549" id="p_549">549</a></b>. A similar remark must be made in reference to theories
based on the belief that the souls of the dead are incarnate in
animals and plants. Such a belief is a natural outgrowth from the
conception of the identity of nature of human beings and animals,
and it occurs in so many parts of the world (Oceania, Africa,
America) that it might naturally be regarded as having been at
one time universal, though it is not now found everywhere.
Reverence for an ancestor might be, and sometimes is, transferred
to the object in which he is supposed to be incarnate; from this
object a man holds himself to be descended, and he refrains from
eating or injuring it.<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> This view, a combination of reverence for
ancestors and reverence for animals and plants, thus supplies two
features of totemistic organization, but proof is lacking that it is
the basis of this organization. If it be the determining consideration
in some cases, there are many cases in which its influence is
not apparent. There are myths tracing the totemism of clans to
ancestors having animal forms, but these myths are relatively late
savage philosophical explanations of existing institutions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_550" id="p_550">550</a></b>. The relation of the individual patron and guardian to the
clan totem has been variously defined. Such a patron, it is sometimes
held (obtained by a dream or a vision), descends from the
original possessor to his children (or, in a matrilineal system, to
his sister's children), and thus becomes the patron (the totem)
of a family or kin; and a larger group, formed by the union of
several kins, may similarly have its protecting spirit. Cases in
which descent is through the mother here make a difficulty&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>man's guardian spirit would not then be inherited. Granting that
the personal patron of a shaman or of an ordinary man may be
inherited, such inheritance appears to be of rare occurrence, and
there is no trustworthy evidence that it ever leads to the formation
of a totemic clan.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_551" id="p_551">551</a></b>. It is true there is a resemblance between a man's relation
to his clan totem and his relation to his personal guardian&mdash;in
both cases the sacred object is revered and spared. It is sometimes
the case also (as, for example, among the Australian Arunta)
that the totem comes through an individual (the mother) and is
not transmissible, and yet endogamous clans arise by the union of
persons having the same totem. But here the resemblance ceases&mdash;the
Arunta child's totem is determined for him before his birth,
but a man chooses his personal guardian for himself, and joins
others having the same guardian, not in a clan but in a secret
society. Furthermore, the institution of the personal guardian is
very rare except in North America, and there flourishes in inverse
proportion to the strength of clan life proper.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_552" id="p_552">552</a></b>. On the supposition of the primitive predominance of the
rule of descent through the mother individualistic theories of the
origin of totemism, with one exception, are out of the question&mdash;the
totem is first chosen by a man, but children would have
the totem not of the father but of the mother. The exception is
the conceptional theory, in which the totem is determined by the
mother&mdash;especially the Mota (Banks Islands) form, in which the
choice of a sacred object by the woman is unlimited. In a small
community a certain number of women would, however, choose
the same object, and thus totemic groups would arise. This scheme
of organization, though not open to the objection mentioned above,
is geographically limited.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_553" id="p_553">553</a></b>. <i>Theories based on clan action.</i> Here the starting-point is the
clan, which is supposed to have come into existence somehow; it is
not essential to determine precisely the method of its origination,
though the question of method is sometimes included in the discussion
of a theory. The clan finds itself confronted by various natural
objects with which, it believes, it must form helpful relations; or some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
sort of relation is forced on it by the conditions of life. The question
is how a human group came to enter into the totemic relation.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_554" id="p_554">554</a></b>. The simplest answer is that the primitive clan deliberately
chose among all associated objects some one to be its particular
friend or its special associate,<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> naturally valued and respected this
object, refrained from eating it when it was edible, took its name,
came to regard it as ancestor, and created myths explanatory
of these conceptions. This general theory has assumed various
forms, but the objection usually made to its central supposition
is that such deliberate choice is out of keeping with the known
methods of early societies. Though a certain amount of reflection
must be assumed for primitive men (the lower animals, indeed,
show reflection), it is held that so elaborate a system as totemism,
like other institutions, must have been the product of accidental
experiences, developed through a long period of time. Something
more definite, it is said, is required in order to account for the
details of the system&mdash;all that can be safely assumed is that early
man, constantly on the alert to better his condition, took advantage
of every situation to strengthen himself by taking precautions
against enemies or by securing the aid of surrounding objects,
human and nonhuman.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_555" id="p_555">555</a></b>. The totem is supposed by some to have been originally
merely the mark or badge by which a human group distinguished
itself from neighboring groups. In hunting expeditions and migrations
such a mark would be necessary or, at any rate, useful.<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a>
More generally, it was natural for a clan to have a name for itself,
as it had names for its individual members and for other objects.
It might take its name from an associated animal or plant or
heavenly body or from a place. The badge and the name once
adopted, other totemic features would follow. Such badges are common
in Northwestern America, and are found elsewhere, and the
term 'totem' has been explained by natives as meaning 'badge.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>But this explanation is late, and the employment of the sacred
object as badge is not widely diffused. When it gives a clan its
name it is, of course, a distinguishing mark, but this does not show
that such distinction was in all cases its original function. Nor
would the badge come into use till the name had been fixed.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_556" id="p_556">556</a></b>. The view just mentioned does not attempt to explain how
a particular name came to be attached to a clan. This lack is
supplied by the theory that a clan was named by its neighbors
after the kind of food on which it chiefly subsisted.<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> The objection
to this theory is that no group of men is known to confine
itself to one article of food&mdash;savages eat whatever they can find&mdash;and
moreover contiguous groups would feed on the same kinds
of food. A view not open to this objection is that names of clans,
also given from without, expressed fancied resemblances of the
persons named to animals and other objects, or peculiarities of
person or speech, or were derived from the place of abode.<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_557" id="p_557">557</a></b>. It is obviously true that human groups have names derived
from objects with which they are somehow specially connected; in
the lists of clan-names in Oceania, Africa, India, America, animal
names predominate, but many are taken from plants, and some
from inanimate objects;<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> when groups become settled they are
sometimes called after their places of abode. The other supposition
in these "name theories"&mdash;that the names are given from
without&mdash;is less certain. There are examples of such naming by
outsiders&mdash;nicknames, sometimes respectful, sometimes derisive.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a>
But the known cases are not numerous enough to establish a
general rule&mdash;the origin of names of clans and tribes is largely
involved in obscurity.<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> There is no improbability in either theory
of the method of naming, native or foreign&mdash;both modes may
have existed, one in one region, one in another, and one group
may at different times have been called by different names.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span><b><a name="p_558" id="p_558">558</a></b>. "Co&ouml;perative" theories suppose that a number of groups
united for economic purposes, to each being assigned the duty of
increasing by magical means the supply of a particular sort of food
or other necessity, and procuring a portion for the general store.<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a>
Such co&ouml;peration, however, assumes too great a capacity of organization
to be primitive. It is hardly found outside of Central Australia,
in which region there are indications of a long period of social
development.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_559" id="p_559">559</a></b>. The theory that the totem is a god, immanent in the clan,
incarnate in every member of the clan, a divine ancestor, the center
of the clan's religion,<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> is contradicted by the actual relation between
a clan and its totem: the latter is cherished as a kinsman and friend,
but not worshiped as a god.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_560" id="p_560">560</a></b>. <i>Summing-up on the origin of totemism.</i> This brief survey
of proposed theories of the origin of totemism is sufficient to show
the complexity of the problem. Not one of the hypotheses just
mentioned is universally accepted, and no one of them appears
to account satisfactorily for all the known facts. Some of them
are based obviously on data derived from limited areas. Australian
usage suggested the co&ouml;perative theory, and Australia and Melanesia
the conceptional theory. The identification of totemism with
ancestor-worship comes from South Africa; its connection with
the belief in transmigration is due to Indonesia; its derivation from
the individual guardian is based on a North American institution;
and North America probably suggested the badge theory also. It
may be frankly confessed that in the present state of knowledge
all theories are guesses.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_561" id="p_561">561</a></b>. As there are communities in which it is probable or possible
that totemism has never existed, so it is conceivable that it
has been developed in different ways in different places. Considering
the variety of circumstances in primitive life, it would not be
strange if human groups found themselves impelled to take various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>paths in their attempts at effective organization. The starting-point
being reverence for animals and other objects of nature, and belief
in their kinship with men, one human group may have been
led by some accidental experience to regard some nonhuman group
or object as its ally. In another case a name, adopted by a group
of its own accord or given it from without, may have induced such
an alliance. Individuals may have imposed their guardian animals
or plants on communities. A badge, chosen for convenience, may
have been the beginning of a totemic organization. In these and
other ways a group of men may have come to form intimate relations
with a nonhuman group or other object.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_562" id="p_562">562</a></b>. This fundamental relation having been established (with
aversion to eating or injuring the sacred object), various usages
would attach themselves to it in accordance with general laws of
social development. In many cases a rule of exogamy, for the
better regulation of marriage, would be adopted. When tribes,
consisting each of several clans, came into existence, a co&ouml;perative
economic system would sometimes arise: magical methods of
producing results, common in early stages of life, would be so organized
that to every clan would be assigned the duty of producing
a supply of some sort of food. Following the general tendency to
genealogical construction, the belief in kinship with the sacred object
would lead a clan to imagine an ancestor of the same kind,
animal or animal-human or plant or rock, and myths explaining
the origin would be devised. Various other usages and ideas would
coalesce with those belonging to totemism proper: belief in the
superhuman power of nonhuman things, including the conception of
mana; the belief that every newborn child is the reincarnation of an
ancestor; recognition of omens from the movements of such things;
belief in the magical power of names; reverence for ancestors&mdash;a
natural feeling, in itself independent of the totemic conception; totems
regarded as creators; the employment of totemic animals as
emissaries to the supernatural Powers. Thus the resultant social system
would be a congeries of beliefs and usages, and in such a system,
when it appears, the totemic element must be distinguished from its
attachments, which must be referred each to its appropriate source.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="p_563" id="p_563">563</a></b>. <i>Function of totemism in the development of society.</i> The
service of totemism to society lies in the aid it has given to the
friendly association of men in groups. Common social feeling,
the perception of the advantage to be gained by combination in the
quest for food and for defense against human enemies, originated
the formation of groups. Totemism strengthened union by increasing
the sense of brotherhood in the clan and facilitating the c&ouml;operation
that is a condition of social progress. This sort of service
was rendered in early times by all systems in which social relations
were connected with relations to animals and other natural objects;
but totemism made a special appeal to the emotions and gave all
the members of a human group one and the same object of devotion
about which sentiments of loyalty and brotherhood could crystallize.
It is a crude, initial political form that has given way to more definite
forms.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_564" id="p_564">564</a></b>. It cannot be said that totemism has contributed to <i>economic</i>
progress except in so far as every stable organization may be favorable
to general progress. It has been claimed that it effected the
domestication of animals and plants.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> In support of this claim it is
urged that, apart from reverence for these objects, there is nothing
in savage ideas and customs that could lead to domestication. Early
man, seeking food, would try all accessible animals and plants&mdash;but
why, it is asked, should he desire to keep them as attachments
to his home and cultivate them for his own use? Would his purpose
be amusement? But, though savages sometimes have animals
as pets, the custom is not general, and such pets are freely killed.
Could the motive be utility? The answer is that savages have
neither the ability to perceive the advantage, for food and labor,
that would accrue from domestication, nor knowledge of the fact
that seeds must be kept, in order to secure a crop, from one year
to another, nor the self-restraint to practice present abstinence for
the sake of future good.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span><b><a name="p_565" id="p_565">565</a></b>. On the other hand, it is said, semireligious reverence for
animals preserves them from injury, they lose their fear of man,
and those that are domesticable become tame and are appropriated
and used by men; and sacred plants are retained from one year to
another for ritual purposes, and their seeds produce a succession
of crops. Totem animals are not eaten&mdash;a pastoral people does
not eat its cattle, it keeps them for their milk. In a word, animals,
it is held, are not tamed by man of set purpose, but grow tame
when not molested, and those that are edible or capable of rendering
service are gradually domesticated; and similarly, through
religious use of plants, the possibility of cultivating certain plants
becomes known.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_566" id="p_566">566</a></b>. This argument rests on the assumption of the universal
mental incapacity of early men&mdash;a subject admittedly obscure.
Certainly they appear to be quite lacking in knowledge and reflection
in some regards; yet they sometimes show remarkable
skill in hunting (so, for example, the African Pygmies), and they
have created remarkable languages. But, if we leave the question
of intellectual capacity aside, there are facts that seem to throw
doubt on the totemic origin of domestication. In the first place,
the conditions under which reverence for a totemic animal may
make it tame do not appear to have existed in totemic society.
For such taming it is necessary that the animal be perfectly safe
within a considerable area. But this is not possible where a group
of men is composed of various clans, a given animal being spared
by one clan but freely hunted and killed by all the other clans<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a>&mdash;a
state of things that was presumably universal.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_567" id="p_567">567</a></b>. Further, it is difficult to discover any historical connection
between the actual cases of domestication of animals and reverence
for these as totems. It is unfortunate for the decision of this question
that in the two principal totemic centers, Australia and North
America, there are very few native domesticable animals&mdash;only
one (a species of dog) in Australia, and two (dog and bison) in
North America. The history of the dog in North America, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>is suggestive: it has been domesticated by totemic Redmen for hunting
purposes and by nontotemic Eskimo for drawing sledges&mdash;that
is, its economic use seems to be independent of totemic considerations.
Other cases of divergence between employment of animals
and their position as totems have been cited in Uganda, for example;<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a>
but civilization is relatively far advanced in Uganda, and in
such cases we cannot infer original conditions from existing customs.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_568" id="p_568">568</a></b>. It may fairly be surmised that observation in some cases
led to the domestic use of animals. The value of the milk of cattle,
goats, and mares as food may have been suggested to men who
were acquainted with the life of these animals; and valuing them
for their milk, their owners would abstain from eating them except
under pressure of hunger or for ceremonial purposes. Such a procedure
does not seem to be beyond the capacities of very simple
communities. Chance may have suggested the function of seeds
in the growth of plants, and, agriculture once entered on, the labor
of animals would gradually be utilized. So far as regards artistic
representations, these are found everywhere, and their occurrence
on totemic poles (as, for example, among the Haidas of Queen Charlotte
Islands) cannot be regarded as a special product of totemism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_569" id="p_569">569</a></b>. Considering the obscurity of the subject, it is doubtless
wise to refrain from offering a universal theory of the origin of
domestication of animals and plants. All that is here contended
for is that the large r&ocirc;le sometimes assigned to totemism in this
regard is not supported by the facts now known to us. Future investigations
may bring with them new constructions of early history.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_570" id="p_570">570</a></b>. <i>Relation of totemism to religion.</i> As the beginnings of
totemism are obscure it is not possible to say exactly what a man's
attitude toward his totem was in the earliest period. But, when the
totemic relation became a definite feature of social organization, the
feeling was that the totem was in the nature of a clansman, of
the same blood as the human group, and entitled to all the respect
and affection with which men regarded their clan-brethren. The
sentiment, in this point of view, was sacred in the sense in which
this term may be used of the feeling existing between persons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>the same human group; it involved a certain sense of obligation
toward fellow members&mdash;to respect their rights and to defend them
against enemies was an imperative duty.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_571" id="p_571">571</a></b>. Totemic clanship, however, differed from ordinary human
clanship in that the nonhuman clan-brother was regarded as a
specially powerful being, endowed with the superhuman qualities
with which all animals and plants and certain other objects were
credited. Regard for the totem was, thus, part of the regard paid
to nonhuman objects in general, only emotionalized and intensified
by the belief that the nonhuman group was in a peculiar way allied
to the human group. There was not only unwillingness to injure
the totem&mdash;there was fear that one would suffer by such an act.
The totem, it was believed, was able in its turn to inflict injury;
and this belief added an element of awe to the feeling with which
it was regarded.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_572" id="p_572">572</a></b>. In another respect, also, the totem shared the powers of
other nonhuman objects&mdash;it could aid its friends. The expectation
of totemic aid is, however, vague in the earlier stages of organization,
that is, in communities in which totemism proper is well-defined&mdash;it
appears to amount to little more than a feeling that things
will go well if respect is paid to the totem. In cases where there
is more definite aid there is always the question whether the aid
is afforded by the totem in its specific character of clan-brother or
merely in its character of nonhuman powerful thing. Omens, for
example, are given by all natural objects; when an object of this
sort happens to be a totem, it is not clear that its capacity of omen-giving
belongs to it simply as totem.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_573" id="p_573">573</a></b>. There is similar uncertainty in the case of the Queensland
practice, when a man, on lying down at any time or rising in the
morning, whispers the name of the animal after which he is called
or the name of the animal belonging to his group-division, in the
belief that it will give him success in his affairs;<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> here the animal
is not a clan totem, and the evidence does not show that it has
come from such a totem&mdash;it may be a sacred animal that has
somehow been brought into special connection with the man or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>with his group. Personal guardians that confer magical powers
on a man do not here come into consideration.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_574" id="p_574">574</a></b>. The relation between totemism and the practice of magic
appears to be essentially one of coexistence in a community. The
two belong to the same stage of culture and the same order of
ideas; but the fact that each is found without the other shows that
neither is dependent on the other. Naturally they are sometimes
combined, as sometimes happens in North America and particularly
in Central Australia (where every totemic clan is charged with certain
magical ceremonies); yet this close alliance is rare. Magical
practice rests on a conception of man's relation to nature that is
distinct from the conception of kinship between a human clan and
a nonhuman species or individual object.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_575" id="p_575">575</a></b>. Secret societies sometimes perform magical ceremonies;
but such societies are not totemic&mdash;either they have risen above
the totemic point of view, or they have sprung from ideas and
usages that are independent of totemism proper.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_576" id="p_576">576</a></b>. It is difficult to find a clear case of the offering of religious
worship to a totem as totem. There are the ceremonies performed
by the Australian Warramunga for the purpose of propitiating or
coercing the terrible water snake Wollunqua.<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> This creature is a
totem, but a totem of unique character&mdash;a fabulous animal, never
visible, a creation of the imagination; the totem proper is a visible
object whose relations with human beings are friendly, the Wollunqua
is savage in nature and often hostile to men. He appears
to be of the nature of a god, but an undomesticated one&mdash;a demon,
adopted by a tribe as totem, or identified with a previously existing
totem. The situation is an exceptional one and cannot be regarded
as evidence of general totemic worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_577" id="p_577">577</a></b>. The question whether a totem ever develops into a god is
a part of the general question whether a sacred animal ever becomes
a god.<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> The complications of early ideas and customs and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>the paucity of data for the formative period of early religion make
an answer to these questions difficult. As far as regards the evolution
of the totem into a true divine figure the evidence is not decisive.
The identification of heroes or gods with animals, their transformations
into animals, and their incarnations in animal forms may,
indeed, suggest such an evolution. Thus, in the island of Yam
(between Australia and New Guinea) two brothers, Sigai and
Maiau, have their shrines, in which they are represented by a shark
figure and a crocodile figure respectively, and to them food is presented,
songs are sung, dances are danced and prayers are offered.
Other heroes, Kwoiam (a totem-bringer), Sida (an introducer of
the arts of life), Yadzebub (a warrior), and some unnamed are
revered in islands of Torres Straits.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> In the Rewa district in Fiji
every village, it is said, has a deity, and these deities have the power
of turning into animals, which are then not eaten&mdash;that is, it may
be supposed, the god is a developed totem.<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> In the Wakelbura
tribe of Southeast Australia the totem animal is spoken of as
"father," a title frequently given to clan gods. Household gods are
considered to be incarnate in animals and other objects in some of
the Caroline Islands, in Tonga and Tikopia, and in Samoa, and
in these islands, except Samoa, the people are supposed to have
descended from the animals in question. Similar ideas seem not
to exist in the Americas or in Africa; in India the influence of
Hindu cults has largely effaced or greatly modified non-Aryan
usages so that their original form cannot generally be determined.<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_578" id="p_578">578</a></b>. The cases just mentioned are susceptible of other explanations
than that of an evolution from totem to god. The history
of the cult of heroes in Yam and other Torres Straits islands is
obscure, but from known facts the indications are that the hero
figures have arisen independently of the totem figures and have
been, by a natural process, identified with these.<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> The peculiarity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>of the Rewa deities is that they assume animal forms at will, and
such animals, not being eaten, are held to be totems. Whether totems
or not they are sacred and might easily be identified with gods who
stood alongside of them; an obvious explanation of this identity
would be that the god assumed the form of the animal.<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> A similar
explanation may be given of incarnations of gods in animals&mdash;a
metamorphosis is a temporary incarnation. The Samoan Moso is
incarnate in half a dozen different objects, and some deities are
incarnate in men. As for the title "father," it belongs of course
to the object from which a clan is supposed to be descended.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_579" id="p_579">579</a></b>. The sacramental eating of the totem, where such a custom
exists, involves a certain identity of nature of totem and clan god,
but the two are regarded as distinct&mdash;their distinctness is, indeed,
a necessary condition of the sacrificial efficacy of the totem as a
means of placating the deity.<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_580" id="p_580">580</a></b>. Our review seems, thus, to lead to the conclusion that there
is no good ground for the opinion that a totem has ever grown
into a god. The question, belonging, as it does, to a period for
which we have no contemporary records, must be admitted to be
difficult, and answers to it must be of the nature of hypotheses;
but gods and spirits appear to have taken shape through processes
of thought different from those that lie at the basis of totemism.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Taboo</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_581" id="p_581">581</a></b>. So far we have been considering the growth of the simpler
religious ideas and the parallel development of a quasi-religious
social organization. The ethical development is no less important
than the religious and the political, with which it has always been
closely connected. Ethical ideas and customs are in their origin
independent of religion. Religion deals with the relation between
human beings and supernatural Powers; ethics has to do with the
relation between man and man.<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span><b><a name="p_582" id="p_582">582</a></b>. Thus, the necessity for the protection of life and property
(including wives and children) has produced certain rules of conduct,
which are at first handed on orally and maintained by custom, and
gradually are formulated in written codes. The protection of the
tribal life is secured by the tribal leaders as representatives of
society. The protection of individual interests is at first in the
hands of the individuals concerned, but always under the sanction
of society. The murderer, the thief, and the adulterer are dealt
with by the person injured or by his clan or family, in accordance
with generally recognized regulations. As social life becomes more
elaborate, such regulations become more numerous and more discriminating;
every new ethical rule springs from the necessity of
providing for some new social situation. In all communities the
tendency is toward taking the protection of interests out of the
hands of the individual and committing it to the community; this
course is held to be for the advantage of society.<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_583" id="p_583">583</a></b>. As men are constituted, to account for the growth of moral
customs we need to assume only social life; practically all our requirements
that refer to the relations between men are found
among early tribes, and it may be taken for granted that any body
of human beings, living together and having some form of activity,
would work out some such system of rules, mostly negative or
prohibitive but also to some extent positive. Even the law of kindness,
a product of natural human sympathy, exists among the
lowest known peoples. The reference of moral growth to social
necessities does not involve the denial of a germinal sense of right
and wrong or of germinal moral ideals, but this sense and these
ideals arise, through reflection, from experience. We are here concerned
only with the actual conduct of men traceable in the early
forms of society.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_584" id="p_584">584</a></b>. But while social life is the basis of ethical construction, the
actual ethical constitution of men has been influenced by religion,
in later times by the supplying of lofty ideals and sanctions, in
early times by a magical determination of things injurious. It
is this second category that is covered by the term 'taboo,' a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>Polynesian word said to mean 'what is prohibited.' Prohibitions
arising from natural human relations constitute civil law; those
arising from extrahuman or other magical influences constitute
taboo.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_585" id="p_585">585</a></b>. Early man, regarding all objects as possibly endowed with
power, selects out of the whole mass by observation and experience
certain objects which affect his life, his relations with which
he finds it desirable to define. These are all mysterious;<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> some
are helpful, some harmful. The helpful objects become lucky
stones, amulets. The injurious or dangerous objects are the more
numerous; in an atmosphere of uncertainty the mysterious is
dreaded, avoided, and guarded against by rules.<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_586" id="p_586">586</a></b>. The objects affected by the conception of taboo are as
various as the conditions of human life&mdash;they include things inanimate
and animate, and events and experiences of all sorts. Sometimes
the danger is supposed to be inherent in the object, sometimes
the quality of dangerousness is imposed on it or infused into it by
some authority; but in all cases there is present the force (mana)
that, in savage theory, makes the external world a factor in human
destinies.<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> This force may be transmitted from one object to
another (usually by contact<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a>), and thus the taboo infection may
spread indefinitely, a silent and terrible source of misfortune, sometimes
to a single person, sometimes to a whole community. Ceremonies
connected with taboo are designed to protect against this
destructive influence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span><b><a name="p_587" id="p_587">587</a></b>. The principal taboo usages may be classed roughly under
certain heads, which, however, will sometimes overlap one another.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_588" id="p_588">588</a></b>. <i>Taboos connected with the conception of life.</i> For early man
the central mystery of the world was life, and mystery and danger
attached to all things connected with its genesis, maintenance, and
cessation&mdash;to pregnancy, birth, death, corpses, funerals, blood.
Against these things precautions, in the form of various restrictions,
had to be taken. Pregnancy was sometimes regarded as due
to supernatural agency, and in all cases was noted as a mysterious
condition in which the woman was peculiarly exposed to evil influences;
she was sometimes required to keep her head covered or

<p><b><a name="p_589" id="p_589">589</a></b>. Care for women during pregnancy and after the birth of
a child might be induced by natural human kindliness. But certain
usages in connection with birth indicate fear of superhuman dangers.
In many regions (Central Asia, Africa, Oceania, China) the
mother is taboo for a certain time, being regarded apparently as
a source of danger to others, as well as being herself exposed to
danger. The child also is surrounded by perils. Mother and child
are protected by isolation, ablutions (baptism), amulets, conjurations,
and by consecration to a deity.<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> The intimate relation between
father and child may make it necessary to impose taboos on the
former&mdash;he is sometimes required to go to bed (the <i>couvade</i>, or
man-childbed), to abstain from work and from certain foods held
to be injurious, and to avoid touching weapons and other dangerous
things; thus, through the identity of father and child, the latter is
guarded against the hostile mana that may be lurking near. The
seclusion of the mother sometimes varies in duration according to
the sex of the child; in most cases, apparently, the period is longer
for a male child;<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> in the Jewish ritual the period for the maid-child
is twice as great (eighty days) as that for the male;<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> the difference
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>in the points of view, perhaps, is that the evil influence may
direct itself particularly against, or be more serious for, the male as
socially the more important, or it may be more dangerous for the
female as the weaker.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_590" id="p_590">590</a></b>. <i>Taboos connected with death.</i> The danger to the living
arising from a death is of a twofold nature: the corpse, as a
strange, uncanny thing, is a source of peril; and there are possible
external enemies&mdash;the spirit that produced the death, and the
ghost of the departed. Against these dangerous things avoidance
of the corpse is the common precaution&mdash;a dead body must
not be touched, or, if it is touched, he who touches must undergo
purification.<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> Perhaps the various modes of disposing of corpses
(exposure, inhumation, cremation) were originally attempts to get
rid of their dangerous qualities; later other motives came in. The
body of a suicide was especially feared, and was staked down on
a public way to prevent its reappearance; it was perhaps the abnormal
and desperate character of the death that produced this
special fear. The dread of a corpse is, however, not universal
among savages&mdash;in many cases it is eaten, simply as food or to
acquire the qualities of the deceased, or for other reasons. It is
feared as having hurtful power, it is eaten as being sacred or helpful.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_591" id="p_591">591</a></b>. The house in which a death occurs shares the evil power
of the dead body, and sometimes must be destroyed, together with
all its furniture, or abandoned or purified.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> Death diffuses its baleful
influence through the atmosphere, making it unfavorable for
ordinary work, which, accordingly, is often then suspended for a

of spouse or name with the dead effects the transmission of what is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>dangerous in him. In another direction the earthly dwelling of a dead
person is protected&mdash;a curse is pronounced on one who violates it.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_592" id="p_592">592</a></b>. <i>Taboos connected with woman and the relations between

of women and of their belongings under certain circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a>
The ground of this fear may lie in those physiological peculiarities
of woman which are regarded as mysterious and dangerous, and
the antagonism of feeling may have been increased by the separation
between the sexes consequent on the differences in their social
functions and their daily pursuits. Woman seems to move in a
sphere different from that of man; she acts in ways that are
strange to him. Whatever its ground, the feeling of dread is a real
one: a case is reported of a man who, on learning that he had lain
down on his wife's blanket, became violently ill.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_593" id="p_593">593</a></b>. Various restrictions are imposed on women at periods of
sexual crisis. The girl on reaching the age of puberty is generally
(though not always<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a>) immured, sometimes for weeks or months,
to shield her from noxious influences, human and nonhuman. During
menstruation a woman is isolated, may not be looked on by the
sun, must remain apart from her husband, and her food is strictly
regulated.<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> It is not infrequently the case that certain foods are
permanently forbidden women, for what special reasons is not
clear.<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> The rule forbidding a wife to eat with her husband may
have come originally from nonreligious social considerations (her
subordination to the man, or the fact that she belonged to a social
group different from his), but in that case it later acquired a religious
character. Women have commonly been excluded in savage communities
from solemn ceremonies (as those of the initiation of males)
and from tribal councils;<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> such rules may have originated in the
natural differentiation of social functions of the sexes or in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>desire of men to keep the control of tribal life in their own hands,
but in many cases the presence of women was supposed to vitiate
the proceedings supernaturally. In industrial enterprises, such as
hunting and fishing, they are sometimes held to be a fatal influence.<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a>
In family life a wife's mother was debarred from all social intercourse
with her son-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_594" id="p_594">594</a></b>. Where procreation was ascribed to the union of the sexes,
sexual intercourse, as being intimately connected with life, was
credited with supernatural potency, generally unfavorable to vigor.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a>
It has been largely prohibited on all important public occasions,
such as hunting and war, and particularly in connection with religious
ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> Various considerations may have contributed
to the establishment of such customs, but in their earliest form we
have, probably, to recognize not any moral effort to secure chastity,
but a dread of injurious mana resident in women.<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> We may compare
the fact that women have often been regarded as specially
gifted in witchcraft.<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_595" id="p_595">595</a></b>. <i>Taboos connected with great personages.</i> The theory of
mana includes the belief that special supernatural power resides in
the persons of tribal leaders, such as magicians, chiefs, priests. It
follows that danger attaches to their bodies (particularly to head,
hair, and nails), to their names, and to their food and other belongings.
These things must be avoided: their food must not be eaten
by common folk; their houses and other property must not be
used; their nail-cuttings must be buried so that danger may be
averted from the community; their names must not be mentioned.
They themselves, being peculiarly sensitive to malign influences,
must be protected in the house and when they walk out; and it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>in some cases not safe for the common man to look on the chief
as he passes through the village.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_596" id="p_596">596</a></b>. Not all these regulations are found in any one community,
but the principle is the same everywhere. The greatest development
of taboo power in chiefs occurs in Polynesia, the home of
taboo. There they are all-powerful. Whatever a chief touches becomes
his property. If he enters a house, steps into a canoe, affixes
his name to a field, it is his. His control appears to be limited only
by the accident of his momentary desire. No one thinks of opposing
his decisions&mdash;that would be fatal to the opposer. This social
situation passes when a better form of civil government is established,
but some features of the old conception cling to later dignitaries:
till recently the nail-parings of the emperor of Japan were
carefully disposed of lest, being inadvertently touched, they should
bring misfortune.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_597" id="p_597">597</a></b>. A priest also may carry taboo infection on his person. In
Ezekiel's scheme of ritual organization it is ordered that when the
priest, having offered sacrifice, goes forth into the outer court where
the people are, he shall put off the garments in which he ministered
and lay them in a sacred place, and put on other garments, lest
some one touching him should be made ritually unclean, that is
taboo, forbidden to mingle with his fellows or to do his ordinary
work for a certain time (generally till the evening).<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> In many regions
there have been and are numerous restrictions on priests,
some of which are in their own interests (to preserve their ritual
purity), some in the interests of others (to guard them against the
infection of taboo).<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> Other quasi-official or devoted persons (as,
for example, the Hebrew Nazirite<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a>) were subject to restrictions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>food. Strangers, who in a primitive period were frequently put
to death, in a more humane period were subjected to purifying
processes in order to remove the taboo infection that might cling
to them.<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_598" id="p_598">598</a></b>. <i>Industrial taboos.</i> The customs of certain Polynesian
chiefs, described above, cannot be said to aid industry, but there
are taboo usages designed to protect and further popular occupations.
These doubtless have a natural nonmagical basis&mdash;the
necessity of making good crops and protecting private property
would be recognized everywhere, and would call forth legal enactments;
but it was inevitable, in certain communities, that such
enactments should be strengthened by supernatural sanctions such
as those offered by the conception of taboo.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_599" id="p_599">599</a></b>. Protective arrangements of this sort abound in Oceania
and Indonesia. In Samoa the sweet-potato fields are taboo till
the crop is gathered.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> Hawaiian fisheries are protected by the simple
device of forbidding the taking of certain fish at certain seasons;
here the economic motive is obvious, but taboo penalties are
annexed.<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> During planting time in New Zealand all persons employed
in the work were taboo for other occupations and obliged to give
all their time to the planting; and the same rule held for hunting
and fishing.<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> The Borneo Kayans refrain from their usual occupations

Similar restrictions, of an elaborate kind, are in force in Sumatra,<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a>
and in Assam.<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_600" id="p_600">600</a></b>. The property of private persons was protected: the common
man might impose a taboo on his land, crops, house, and garments,
and these were then safe from depredation. It was true,
however, in New Zealand as elsewhere, that the potency of the imposed
taboo depended on the influence of him who imposed it;
chiefs, as uniting in their persons civil and religious authority, were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>the most powerful persons in the community, and taboos ordered
by them were the most effective. In Melanesia taboo is largely
employed for the protection of private property&mdash;curses are pronounced
against trespassers, and the authority of the tabooer is
re&euml;nforced by that of the local spirit or ghost (<i>tindalo</i>);<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> here
taboo has become definitely an element of civil law, in which it
tends to be absorbed.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_601" id="p_601">601</a></b>. <i>Taboos connected with other important social events.</i> It appears
that all occurrences supposed to affect the life of the community
have been, and often still are, regarded as bringing with
them, or as attended by, supernatural influences (resident in mana
or in spirits) that may be dangerous. Against these perils the
usual precautions are taken, one of the commonest (as in cases
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs) being abstinence from
ordinary work; the belief, apparently, is that such work is tainted
with the injurious influence with which the atmosphere is charged.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_602" id="p_602">602</a></b>. Among religious ceremonies the expulsion of evil spirits
was naturally attended with danger, and work was prohibited.
Such was the custom in Athens at the Anthesteria and on the
sixth day of the Thargelia, and in Rome at the Lemuria.<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> Among
existing tribes there are numerous examples of this sort of restriction:
it is found in West Africa<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> and in Indonesia (Kar Nicobar,
Bali<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a>); in Assam it takes the form of a taboo (<i>genna</i>) for laying
to rest the ghosts of all who have died within the year<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> (an All
Souls ceremony).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_603" id="p_603">603</a></b>. In general, sacred seasons, times of great communal ceremonies,
demand the avoidance of ordinary pursuits, which, it is
feared, may imperil the success of the ceremonies by necessitating
contact with things infected or nonsacred. The earlier
Hebrew usage recognized such seasons (new moon, sabbath, and
perhaps others); the later usage increased the number of tabooed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>days as the ritual was expanded and organised.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> For Greece
we have the Plynteria, on the principal day of which work was
suspended;<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> in Rome the feriae were such days, regular or occasional.<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a>
The inbringing of first fruits was a peculiarly solemn
occasion, when gratitude to the deity mingled with fear of hostile

Polynesian restrictions on the occasion of ceremonies are given by
Ellis.<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> All such days of abstinence from ordinary work tend to become
holidays, times of popular amusement, and a taboo element
may be suspected in such festivals as those of the later Hindu period.<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a>
Naturally, also, days of restriction become sacred to deities.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_604" id="p_604">604</a></b>. Great nonreligious tribal events and peculiar situations demand
restrictive precautions. Warriors prepare for an expedition
by remaining apart from their wives.<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> Women whose husbands
are absent are sometimes immured or forbidden all intercourse
with human beings; by reason of the identity of husband and wife
supernatural harm to the latter will affect the former. Afflictive
occurrences, such as famines, pestilences, earthquakes, are signs
of some hostile supernatural power, defense against which requires
the avoidance of ordinary pursuits. Arbitrary enactments by chiefs
may attach restrictions to a particular day. Sometimes restrictive
usages, of obscure origin, become communal law. Thus, every
Toda clan has certain days of the week (not the occasion of special
ceremonies) in which it is forbidden to follow ordinary occupations;
among the things forbidden are the giving of feasts, the
performance of funeral ceremonies, the cutting of nails, and shaving;
women and dairymen may not leave the village, and the
people and buffaloes may not move from one place to another.<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a>
Doubtless this system of prohibitions is the outcome of many generations
of experience&mdash;the organization of various local usages.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span><b><a name="p_605" id="p_605">605</a></b>. <i>Taboos connected with the moon.</i> Unusual celestial phenomena,
such as eclipses, meteors, and comets, have always excited
terror, being referred to some hostile supernatural agency, and
have called forth special placative and restrictive ceremonies. They
are accounted for in savage lore by various myths.<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> But the permanently
important taboos have been those that are associated
with the phases of the moon. These periodical transformations,
unexplained and mysterious, seemed to early man to have vital
relation with all earthly life&mdash;the waxing and waning of the moon
was held to determine, through the sympathy existing between all
things, the growth and decay of plants, animals, and men.<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> Hence
arose the widely diffused belief that all important undertakings
should be begun while the moon was increasing, and innumerable
regulations for the conduct of affairs were established, not a few
of them surviving in civilized popular belief and practice to the
present day.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_606" id="p_606">606</a></b>. Sometimes the changes in the moon are minutely observed.
The Nandi describe every day of the month by the appearance of
the moon or by its relation to occupations.<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> Natural observation
in some cases divided the lunar month into four parts: the Buddhist
uposatha days are the four days in the lunar month when the

3d-6th, 14th-15th, 24th-25th, 27th-28th days of every month
were taboo periods;<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> the Babylonians had five such periods in
certain months (four periods with one period intercalated). But,
though the quartering of the lunation may seem to us the most
natural division of the month, in actual practice it is rather the
exception.<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> The simplest division, indeed, is that into two parts,
determined by new moon and full moon (Cambodia, Siam; cf. the
Mexican period of thirteen days). The division into three periods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>of ten days each (Egypt, Greece, Annam, Japan) ignores lunar
phases and seeks a convenient and symmetrical arrangement.
With this decimal system is perhaps connected the division of the
month into six periods of five days each (Yoruba, Java, Sumatra,
and perhaps Babylonia). The Romans had a somewhat irregular
official division of the first half of the month into three parts
(Kalends, Nones, Ides) corresponding in a general way to lunar
phases, and also commercial periods of eight days (<i>nundinae</i>),
perhaps of similar origin. A seven-day division is found in
Ashantiland (and perhaps in Peru), and in Java there is reported
a division of a year into thirty periods of seven days each.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_607" id="p_607">607</a></b>. It appears, then, that in several communities there has been
a division of the month in the interests of convenience, without
regard to lunar phases; that in several cases a seven-day week has
been fallen upon; and that of the phases of the moon new moon
and full moon have been most frequently looked to as chronological
marks. The new moon, apart from its function of indicating the
beginning of the lunar month, has also by many tribes been hailed
with joy as a friend restored to life after seeming extinction.<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> The
full moon, while it has not entered so intimately into the emotional
life of man, has played an important part by marking the division
of the month into two equal parts.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_608" id="p_608">608</a></b>. <i>The Hebrew sabbath.</i> Taboo days are days of abstinence

however, by no means clear. Theories that derive it from the cult

a supernatural Power<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> may be set aside. It may be assumed that
it is an early institution somehow connected with the moon, and
a definite indication of origin appears to be furnished by the fact
that in a Babylonian inscription the term <i>shabattu</i><a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> is used for the
full moon. The identification of Hebrew sabbath with full moon
is favored by the collocation of new moon and sabbath in early Old
Testament documents<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> as days on which trading was unlawful.
These, obviously, were the two chief taboo days of the month; the
fact that new moon stands first is doubtless due to its position in
the month.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_609" id="p_609">609</a></b>. It is uncertain whether the Babylonian full-moon day was
ritually particularly important, and it is not clear how the Hebrews
came to invest this day, if it was their sabbath, with peculiar significance.
In the earlier legal documents it is merely a restrictive
period&mdash;man and beast are to rest from toil;<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> in later codes religious
motives for the observance of the day are introduced&mdash;first,
gratitude to Yahweh for the rescue of the nation from Egyptian

creating the world six days and stopped work on the seventh day.<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a>
In the sixth century we find the sabbath elevated to the position

basis of this division is doubtless the quartering of the lunation,
and it has been re&euml;nforced, probably, by considerations of convenience&mdash;seven
is an intermediate number, six days of work and
one of abstinence and rest (holiday) commends itself as a practical
arrangement. It appears among the Hebrews as early as the eighth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>;<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> it may have been derived from or suggested by
Babylonian usage, or it may have been an ancient Hebrew custom&mdash;data
on this point are lacking. In any case the Jewish genius
for religious organization seized on the seven-day scheme and wove
it into the system of worship. A more important step taken by
the Jews was the ignoring of lunar phases (except, of course, new
moon as the beginning of the month) and reckoning the week and
the seventh day (the sabbath) in a continuous line. We have noted
cases in which lunar phases were ignored, but this Jewish arrangement
appears to be unique, and its simplicity and convenience have
commended it to the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_611" id="p_611">611</a></b>. <i>Lucky and unlucky days.</i> The malefic influences emanating
from various objects and resident in the air attached themselves
to certain days, and out of the vast mass of experiences in
every community there grew up systems of days when things might
or might not be done with safety and advantage. There were the
great occasions, economic and astronomical, referred to above, and
there were particular occurrences, such as a death or a defeat, that
stamped a day as unlucky. There are many such beliefs, the origin
of which is lost in a remote antiquity. The ancient civilized nations
had their codes of luck. Egypt had a long list of unlucky days.<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a>
In Babylonia onerous restrictions were imposed on kings, seers,
and physicians on certain days (the 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st, 28th)
of the sixth and eighth months<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> (and perhaps of other months).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>A brief list of days favorable and unfavorable to work is given by
Hesiod.<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> The Roman <i>dies nefasti</i>, properly 'irreligious days,' were
inauspicious, unlucky.<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> Similar lists of lucky and unlucky days are
found among existing tribes,<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> and the popular luck codes in Christian
communities are numerous and elaborate.<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> These have done,
and still do, great harm by substituting irrational for rational rules
of conduct.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_612" id="p_612">612</a></b>. In many of the cases cited above and in many totemistic
regulations there are prohibitions of particular sorts of food. Such
prohibitions, very numerous, are found in all grades of civilization.<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a>
They have arisen from various causes&mdash;climatic conditions,
hygienic beliefs, religious conceptions (as, for example, the recognition
of the sacred character of certain animals, and the connection
of certain foods with supernatural beings and ceremonies<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a>),
sometimes, perhaps, from accidental experiences; the history of
most of the particular usages escapes us. The fundamental principle
involved is the identity of the food with him who eats it&mdash;when
it is charged with supernatural power (by its own sacredness,
or by its connection with a sacred person, or by ecclesiastical
decree) it becomes malefic to an unauthorized person who partakes
of it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_613" id="p_613">613</a></b>. A peculiar form of prohibition of foods appears when a
society is divided into groups that are kept apart from one another
by social and religious traditions that have hardened into civic rules.
In such cases the diet of every group may be regulated by law,
and it may become dangerous and abhorrent for a superior to eat
what has been touched by an inferior. The best example of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>sort of organization is the Hindu system of castes, which has a
marked and unhappy effect on the life of the people.<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> All such
arbitrary social divisions yield gradually to the influence of education
and civic freedom, and this appears to be the tendency in
India at the present day.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_614" id="p_614">614</a></b>. <i>Punishment of violation of taboo.</i> Where the hostile power
is inherent in an object, punishment is supposed to follow violation
automatically&mdash;through contact the malefic influence passes into
the man's body and works destruction. Many experiences seem
to the savage to establish the certainty of such a result. Fervid
belief, moreover, produced by long tradition, acts powerfully on
the imagination, and in taboo-ridden communities thus often brings
about the bodily ill called for by the theory: a man who ate of
food that he found on the roadside, learning afterwards that it
belonged to a chief, fell ill and died in a few hours.<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> When taboo
regulations have been taken up into the civil law,<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> punishment for
violations is inflicted by the civil authorities. The tendency to
make taboo a part of the civil law, and to subordinate the former
to the latter, increases with the advance of knowledge and political
organization; and one result of this movement is that great personages
are sometimes permitted to violate with impunity taboos
imposed by inferiors. The native theory in such cases doubtless
is that the great man's mana overcomes the taboo infection; but
at bottom, we may surmise, lies the sense of the dominance of
civil authority.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_615" id="p_615">615</a></b>. The chief's mana, however, sometimes comes into play
as a means of relief. A man who has inadvertently (or perhaps,
in some instances, purposely) violated a taboo may escape punishment
by touching some part of a chief's body. Here the innate
potency of the superior man expels or destroys the taboo force that
has entered the inferior&mdash;another example of how the primitive theory
of taboo is modified by conceptions of social rank and authority.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span><b><a name="p_616" id="p_616">616</a></b>. <i>Removal of taboo.</i> In general, magical ceremonies may be
employed to counteract the injurious influence resident in a thing
or an act, or to destroy the evil consequences resulting from a
violation of the taboo law. For this purpose sprinkling with water,
bathing in water, and the employment of charms are held to be
effective. Thus in the old Hebrew code the taboo resting on a
house supposed to be infected with the plague is removed by
sprinkling the house with water and the blood of a slain bird, and
setting free a second bird alive, which is supposed to carry the
plague-power off with it.<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> A woman is tabooed forty days at the
birth of a male child, and eighty days at the birth of a female child;
the taboo is removed by a holocaust and a sin-offering.<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_617" id="p_617">617</a></b>. A general taboo regulation may be set aside by tribal
agreement in the interests of convenience or pleasure. On certain
occasions the restrictions on the intercourse of the sexes are
removed for a brief period, at the expiration of which the prohibitory
law resumes its place.<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> Many special ceremonies in various
parts of the world have to do with modifications of marriage
laws.<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_618" id="p_618">618</a></b>. <i>Taboo and magic.</i> Reference is made above to magical
procedures in connection with taboo customs. Taboo and magic
have a common basis in the conception of an occult force (which
may conveniently be called <i>mana</i>) resident in all things, but they
contemplate different sides of this force, and their social developments
are very different. Taboo recognizes the inherent malefic
manifestations of the force (known by supposed experience), and
avoids them; magic uses the mana energy to effect results impossible
for unaided human power. In taboo man feels himself to be
under the dominance of an occult law, and his virtue is blind obedience;
in magic he feels himself to be the master of a great
energy, and what he needs is knowledge. Taboo has originated
a mass of irrational rules for the guidance of everyday life; magic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>has grown into a quasi-science, with an organized body of adepts,
touching religion on one side and real science on another side.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_619" id="p_619">619</a></b>. A closer relationship between magic and taboo has been
assumed in view of the fact that both rest to some extent on the
principle of the association of ideas, the principle that like procedures
produce like results. It is true that some taboo rules depend
on this conception:<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> the flesh of timid animals is avoided, that of
courageous animals is eaten, under the belief that the man partakes
of the character of the food he eats; association with women is
sometimes supposed to make a man or a boy effeminate. It is to
be expected that in the immense number of taboo prohibitions and
precautions some should be found in which the association of ideas
is the determining factor. But for the majority of taboo regulations
this explanation does not hold. In the economic and sexual
taboos mentioned above, in the dread of corpses, in the fear of
touching things belonging to a chief, and in other cases there are
customs that can only be referred to a belief in an injurious potency
residing in certain objects.<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> Practically, savage tribes distinguish
between taboo and magic.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_620" id="p_620">620</a></b>. Contamination of customs has always been the rule in
human communities, early and late, savage and civilized. We have
seen how there has often been a coalescence between taboo regulations
proper and ordinary civil law. To state the case more fully,
these have been fused into a unity of social life with individual
initiative, magical notions, arbitrary enactments. The actual social
constitution even of slightly developed tribes is composite, the outcome
of long experience and experiment in which all the lines of
social feeling and thought have gradually drawn together and been
compacted into a more or less unitary mass. While these lines
have influenced each the others, it is possible, to a considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>extent, to distinguish the sphere of each. Thus we can, in many
cases, see where ordinary civil law comes in to adopt, modify, or
set aside taboo rules, and so we can generally recognize the line of
demarcation between definite taboo and the conception of association
of ideas. In some cases the explanations offered of taboo
customs are afterthoughts&mdash;imagined hypotheses to account for
things already in existence.<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_621" id="p_621">621</a></b>. The despotism exercised by taboo systems over certain
Polynesian communities is one of the extraordinary facts of human
history. In New Zealand and Hawaii the restrictions on conduct
were so numerous and were carried out so mercilessly that life
under these conditions would seem to us intolerable.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> In addition
to a great number of particular prohibitions and to the constant fear
of violating the sacredness of the persons of chiefs and trenching
on their prerogatives, we find in New Zealand the amazing rule
that on the occasion of a great misfortune (as a fire) the sufferer
was to be deprived of his possessions&mdash;the blow that fell on him
was held to affix a stigma to all that he owned. Besides the traditional
taboos there were the arbitrary enactments of chiefs which
might constantly introduce new possibilities of suffering. Yet with
all this the people managed to live in some degree of comfort,
somewhat as in civilized communities life goes on in spite of earthquakes,
epidemics, bank failures, the injustices of law, and the
tyranny of the powerful.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_622" id="p_622">622</a></b>. The duration of certain taboo periods among various peoples
in various ages has varied greatly. Taboos relating to foods, chiefs,
and the intercourse of the sexes are usually permanent everyday
customs; those that relate to economic procedures are in force
for the time demanded by each industry. In Hawaii the catching
of certain species of fish was forbidden for half the year, and
the Borneo harvest taboo (carrying prohibition of other work)
lasts sometimes for weeks. There is mention in a Maori legend
of a taboo of three years.<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> According to the later Hebrew law, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>every seventh year all agricultural operations ceased.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> A portent
may demand a long period of restriction, as in the case of the
Roman nine-day ceremony (<i>novendiales feriae</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> As has been remarked
above, economic taboos are often dictated by convenience&mdash;they
are prudential rules to which a supernatural sanction has
been attached.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_623" id="p_623">623</a></b>. <i>Diffusion of taboo.</i> Polynesia, particularly New Zealand
and Hawaii, is the special home of taboo&mdash;the only region in
which it is known to have taken the form of a well-compacted,
all-embracing system. It exists in Melanesia, but it is there less
complicated and general,<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a> and the same thing is true of British
New Guinea.<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> In parts of Borneo it is found in modified form:
there are two sorts of taboo, one, called <i>mali</i>, absolutely forbidding
work on certain occasions, the other, called <i>penti</i>, allowing work if
it is begun by a person not <i>penti</i>; before the birth of a child the
latter form of taboo rests on both parents.<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> The Land Dyaks
have their <i>lali</i> days and the Sea Dyaks their <i>pemate</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> these terms
being the equivalents of <i>taboo</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_624" id="p_624">624</a></b>. Though there is no proof of the existence of all-pervading
taboo systems among the peoples of Asia and America, there are
notices of taboo regulations in particular cases in these regions. At
the birth of a child the Hindu father was subject to certain restrictions
along with the mother, and his taboo was removed by bathing.<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a>
Among the Sioux Indians on the death of a child the father
is taboo for a period of six months or a year.<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> In West African
Calabar there are taboos (called <i>ibet</i>) on individuals, connected
with spirits, the guardians of children.<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> In Assam economic and
other taboos are elaborate and well organized.<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> Such observances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>in connection with death, are found among the Kafirs<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> and the
Eskimo.<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_625" id="p_625">625</a></b>. For the ancient civilized peoples there is no proof of the
existence of general taboo systems. Various particular prohibitions,
involving a sense of danger in certain things, are mentioned above;
they relate chiefly to corpses, to infected houses, to women in connection
with menstruation and childbirth,<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> to certain official persons
(as the Roman flamen dialis). There are also the lists of unlucky
days (Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, Roman). The origin of food
prohibitions (Hebrew, Pythagorean) is uncertain;<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> they may have
arisen, as is suggested above, from general regard for sacred animals
and plants, or from totemistic relations, or from other conditions
unknown to us; the Hebrew lists of forbidden animals may have
been gradually expanded under the guidance of antagonism to surrounding
non-Yahwistic cults. Whether the ancient taboo usages
are the remains of older more extensive systems or represent the
extreme point to which tabooism was carried by the communities
in question the data do not enable us to decide.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_626" id="p_626">626</a></b>. In various places, outside of the Polynesian area, we find
terms that bear a more or less close resemblance in signification
to taboo.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> Melanesian <i>tambu</i> is that which has a sacred character.<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a>
The Borneo terms (<i>lali</i>, <i>pemate</i>, <i>mali</i>, <i>penti</i>) are mentioned just
above, and there is the <i>pomali</i> of Timor (in the Malayan Archipelago).
The Malagasy <i>fady</i> is defined as 'dangerous, prohibited.'<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a>
In Gabun (West Africa) <i>orunda</i> is said to mean 'prohibited to
human beings.'<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> The Hebrew <i>tam&#275;</i> is used of things dangerous,
not to be touched, ritually defiling,<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> and this sense sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>attaches to the term <i>qadosh</i> (rendered in the English version by
'holy'), which involves the presence of a supernatural (and therefore
dangerous) quality.<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_627" id="p_627">627</a></b>. From all the facts known it may be concluded that the
conception of taboo exists or has existed in some form in a great
part of the world,<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> though its development has differed greatly in
different regions. In general its prevalence appears to have been
in inverse proportion to that of totemism&mdash;it is lacking or feeble
in the chief totemic centers, Australia and North America, and
strongest in Polynesia, where totemism is hardly recognizable. It
may be said that, while totemism appears in those forms of social
life that have been created by hunting communities,<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> taboo is the
product of more settled societies, in which agriculture plays an
important part. But while this is true, at least in a general way,
we are not able to trace all the influences that have determined
the development of totemism and taboo; some of these are lost
in the obscurity of the remote past, and, unfortunately for purposes
of investigation, both taboo and totemism, as we now meet
them in actual operation, are in process of decay. Why, for instance,
taboo has flourished in Hawaii with its fishing industries and has
not flourished in certain half-civilized, partly agricultural North
American tribes we are unable to explain precisely. We may fall
back on the vague statement that every community has accomplished
that for which its genius fitted it, but how the genius of
any one people has fitted it for this or that particular task it is
not always possible to say.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_628" id="p_628">628</a></b>. <i>The disappearance of the taboo system</i> in civilized nations is
to be referred to the general advance in intelligence and morality.
Usually this movement is a gradual and silent one, marked by
a quiet dropping of usages as they come to be held unnecessary
or oppressive. Sometimes a bold individual rebels against the
established custom and successfully introduces a new era: thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>in Yoruba, under an old custom, when a king died his eldest son
was obliged to commit suicide; this custom was set at defiance by
a certain Adelu in 1860, and has not since been observed.<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a> All the
influences that tend to broaden thought go to displace taboo. The
growth of clans into tribes, the promotion of voluntary organizations,
secret societies, which displace the old totemistic groups, the
growth of agriculture and of commercial relations&mdash;all things, in a
word, that tend to make the individual prominent and to further
family life lead naturally to the abrogation of oppressive taboos.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_629" id="p_629">629</a></b>. Doubtless also among lower tribes intercourse with higher
communities has had the same result. One of the most remarkable
episodes in the history of taboo is its complete overthrow in the
Hawaiian Islands in the year 1819 by a popular movement.<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> The
movement was begun by members of the royal family, particularly
by one of the queens, and was eagerly followed by almost the
whole population&mdash;the result was the final overthrow of the system.
This was before the arrival of Christian missionaries; but
as foreigners had visited the islands many years before (Captain
Cook first came in 1778), it is possible that the suggestion of the
reform came from observation of the fact that the taboos were
disregarded by those men without evil effects. In any case it was
the acceptance of better ideas by the people that led to the revolutionary
movement.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_630" id="p_630">630</a></b>. <i>R&ocirc;le of taboo in the history of religion.</i> The relation of
taboo to morality and religion and to the general organization of
society appears from the facts stated above. It has created neither
the sense of obligation nor the determination of what is right or
wrong in conduct. The sense of obligation is coeval with human
society&mdash;man, at the moment when he became man, was already
potentially a moral being (and a religious being as well).<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> His experience
of life induced rules of conduct, and these, with the concurrence
of some hardly definable instincts, became imperative for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>him&mdash;the conception involved in the word 'ought' gradually took
shape. The practical content of the conception was determined by
all sorts of experience; the decisive consideration was whether or
not a given thing was advantageous. The belief arose that certain
disadvantageous things were to be referred to extrahuman influences,
and such things were of course to be avoided&mdash;this belief
produced the taboo system.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_631" id="p_631">631</a></b>. The prohibitions of morality sprang from social relations
with human beings, the prohibitions of taboo from social relations
with superhuman beings&mdash;duties to both classes of beings were
defined by experience. The rule "thou shalt not kill thy clansman"
was a necessity of human society; the rule "thou shalt not touch
a corpse" sprang from the fear of a superhuman, malign, death-dealing
Power. Avoidance of poisonous herbs was an obligation
founded on common experience; avoidance of a chief's food and
certain other foods arose from dread of offending a spirit or some
occult Power. And so with all taboo prescriptions as contrasted
with others relating to conduct.<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_632" id="p_632">632</a></b>. Taboo is in essence religious, not moral. In so far as it
supplies a supernatural sanction for moral conduct proper and
maintains rational social relations (as when a man's wife and other
property are made taboo to all but himself), it is often beneficent.
On the other hand, it is antimoral when it elevates to the rank of
duties actions that have no basis in human relations or are in any
way antagonistic to a healthy human instinct of right. This it has
often done, and there has accordingly resulted a conflict between
it and morality&mdash;a conflict that has formed no small part of the
ethical history of the race, its echoes remaining to the present day.
In all religions it has been hard to bring about an intelligent harmony
between the moral and the ritual. Taboo was not originally
irrational&mdash;it sprang from the belief (rational for the early time)
in the presence of the supernatural in certain objects, and this
belief was held to be supported by early experience, according to
which it seemed that violations of taboo were followed by sickness

with the progress of knowledge and reflection.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_633" id="p_633">633</a></b>. Taboo, being a religious conception, has been adopted and
fostered by all popular systems of religion. It has been set aside
not by religion as such but by all the influences that have tended
to rationalize religion. Religious leaders have modified it so far as
modification has been demanded by public opinion. So enlightened
and spiritual minded a man as the apostle Paul declared that an
unworthy participation in the eucharistic celebration produced
sickness and death.<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> Innumerable are the taboos that have passed
silently into oblivion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_634" id="p_634">634</a></b>. Taboo, then, is a concomitant of man's moral life that has
sometimes opposed, sometimes coalesced with natural morality.
Like all widely extending institutions it has tended in part to weld
men together; like all irrational restrictions it has tended also to
hold men apart. Like all positive law it has fostered the sense
of moral obligation, but like all arbitrary law it has weakened the
power of intelligent and moral obedience. It has been not the
guardian of morality, but a temporary form (useful in a primitive
stage of society) in which a part of the moral law expressed itself.
The real moral force of society has been sympathetic social intercourse,
which, under the guidance of an implicit moral ideal, has
been constantly employed in trying to spiritualize or to reject those
enactments of taboo that have been proved by experience, observation,
and reflection to be injurious.<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>GODS</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_635" id="p_635">635</a></b>. The climax of the organization of external religion appears
in the conception of gods proper; this conception is always associated
with more or less well-developed institutions. Early religious
life expresses itself in ceremonies; the god is the embodiment of
man's ideal of the extrahuman power that rules the world. It is
not always easy to distinguish the true gods from the other supernatural
beings with which early man's world is peopled.<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> As far
as concerns power, the ghosts and the spirits appear to do all that
the gods are credited with doing; the sphere of ghostly action is
practically unlimited, and the spirit that dwells in a spring, in a
river, or in a mountain, is as mighty in his sphere as Indra or Apollo
in his sphere; the difference between them and gods is a difference
of intellectual and moral culture and of the degree of naturalization
in a human society&mdash;a god might be defined as a superhuman
Being fashioned by the thought of a civilized people (the term
'civilized' admitting, however, of many gradations). Still, gods
proper may be distinguished from other Powers by certain characteristics
of person and function. Ghosts are shadowy doubles of
human beings, sometimes nameless, wandering about without definite
purpose except to procure food for themselves, uncertain of
temper, friendly or unfriendly according to caprice or other circumstances,
able to help or to harm, and requiring men to be constantly
on the alert so as not in an unguarded moment to offend
them. Souls of recently deceased ancestors, more highly organized
ghosts, conceived of also as attenuated bodies, have powers not
essentially different from those of the simpler ghosts, but are differentiated
from these in function by their intimate relations with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>the family or clan to which they belong, and by their more definite
human nature; they are as a rule permanently friendly, are capable
of definite sympathetic social intercourse with living men, and are
sometimes controllers and patrons, hardly to be distinguished from
local or departmental gods. Spirits are ethereal beings residing in,
or closely connected with, certain objects (trees, rivers, springs,
stones, mountains, etc.), sometimes permanently attached to these
objects, sometimes detached; roaming about, sometimes kindly,
more generally inimical, authors of disease and death, to be feared
and to be guarded against, but sometimes in function (though not
in origin) identical with ancestral ghosts. Totems, in their developed
form, are revered, but rarely if ever worshiped. The term 'animal-gods'
may mean either living animals regarded as divine, or animals
believed to be the forms assumed by gods; in the latter case they
may be taken to be real gods of an inferior type.</p>

<p>In distinction from the four classes of Powers just mentioned,
a true god is a supernatural being with distinct anthropomorphic
personality, with a proper name or a distinctive title, exercising
authority over a certain land or people or over a department of
nature or a class of phenomena, dwelling generally in a sanctuary
on the earth, or in the sky, or in the other world, and in general
sympathetic with men. Gods have rational human qualities, human
modes of procedure, and are human beings in all things except
power.<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_636" id="p_636">636</a></b>. The god appears to have been at the outset a well-formed
anthropomorphic being. His genesis is different from that of the
ghost, spirit, ancestor, or totem. These, except the spirit, are all
given by experience: totems are familiar objects plainly visible to
the eye; ghosts and ancestors are known through dreams and appearances
by day, and by tradition; and the conception of the spirit
is closely allied to that of the ghost, though it is in part a scientific
inference rather than a fact of experience. In distinction from these
a god is a larger product of imagination, springing from the necessity
of accounting for the existence of things in a relatively refined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>way. The creator is a beast only in low tribes, and in process of
time, if the tribe continues to grow in culture, is absorbed in the
cult of a true god. It is rarely, if ever, that a beast, whether a
totem or only a sacred thing, becomes a god proper.</p>

<p>The best apparent examples of such a growth are the Egyptian
bull Apis, who had his temple and ministers, the Hindu monkey-god
Hanuman, and the divine snake of the Nagas of India.<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> But,
though in these cases the beast forms receive divine worship, it is
not clear whether it is the beast that is worshiped or a god incarnate
in the beast; the question is difficult, the data being meager.
The myths in which gods appear in beast forms do not prove a
development of the former out of the latter. It is not necessary to
suppose that Zeus was once a bull, Artemis a bear or a sow, Adonis
a boar, and Aphrodite a sow or a dove. The myths may be naturally
explained as arising from the coalescence of cults, the local sacred
beast becoming attached to a local deity who had a different birth.</p>

<p>The god is a figure of slow growth. Beginning as a sort of headman,
identified sometimes with an ancestor, sometimes with a beast,
his character is shaped by all the influences that go to form the
tribal life, and he thus embodies from generation to generation the
tribe's ideals of virtue.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_637" id="p_637">637</a></b>. The list of classes of supernatural Powers given above
must be regarded, as is there intimated, as a general one. One
class appears sometimes to shade into another; in the theistic
schemes of low tribes it is often difficult to define the conceptions
of supernatural beings with precision.</p>

<p><i>Early mythical founders of culture.</i> Before proceeding to a consideration
of true gods, a class of beings must be mentioned that
appears to stand on the borderland between divine animals, spirits,
and gods. There are various sorts of beings that appear sometimes
in animal form, sometimes in human form, their function being the
arranging of the affairs of the world, the origination of institutions,
and sometimes a definite creation of various things. The title
"founders" or "transformers" or "culture-heroes" has been given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>them. They arise, just as the true gods do, from the necessity of
accounting for the beginnings of things,<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> and, from a comparison
of the ideas of various tribes, a certain growth in the conception
may be recognized.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_638" id="p_638">638</a></b>. In some cases the figure is that of a mere trickster, a mischievous
being, the hero of countless stories, who acts from caprice
or malice, though his actions may result in advantage to men.
Such are many of the animal forms of the North American Indians:
the coyote of the Thompson River Indians,<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> the raven of North
British Columbia,<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> the mink and the blue jay of the North Pacific
Coast.<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> In other cases, as also to some extent in the Thompson River
region, he appears in a more dignified form as a benevolent organizer.</p>

<p>This growth of the trickster into the real culture-hero may be
referred to a progress in thought and refinement.<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> Among the
Northern Maidu of California there is a sharp distinction between
the two characters: the coyote is tricky and mischievous in the bad
sense, with no desire to do anything profitable to men; the benevolent
and useful work of the world is ascribed to a personage called
"the creator," who is always dignified and regardful of the interests
of man.<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> This sort of distinction, intended to account for the
presence of both good and evil elements of life, is found in inchoate
form among other low peoples (as, for example, the Masai and the
Australians<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a>), but reaches its full proportions only in the great
civilized religions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span><b><a name="p_639" id="p_639">639</a></b>. In this class of vaguely conceived creators or transformers
we may place the Central Australian Arunta ancestors, who embodied
the idea of the identity of beasts and human beings, and
are the originators of all the arts and institutions of the tribes;
they established the totemic groups and the ceremonies, and, in the
developed myth, perpetuate their existence by entering the bodies
of women and being born as human beings.<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> The relative antiquity
of this conception of the origin of things is uncertain; in one point
of view it is crude, but in another it is an elaborate and well-considered
attempt to explain the world. These Arunta ancestors, notwithstanding
their half-bestial forms, are represented as acting in all
regards like human beings, and as having planned a complete
system of tribal organization, but no religious worship is offered
them&mdash;they figure only in sociogonic myths and in the determination
of the totemic status of newborn children. Among the Navahos
we find a combination of beast and man in the work of creation.<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a>
In their elaborate cosmogonic myth the first actors are Coyote,
First Man, and First Woman, and there is discord between Coyote
and his human coworkers. Here again the object seems to be to
account for the diverse elements of the tribal life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_640" id="p_640">640</a></b>. Many such personages, originators or introducers of the arts
of life and the distribution of territory, are described in the folk-tales
and myths of the North American tribes. The conception, it may
be concluded, existed all over the world, though for many communities
the details have not yet been brought to light.<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> A noteworthy
personage of this class is the Melanesian Qat (especially
prominent in the Banks Islands), a being credited with almost
plenary power, the creator or arranger of seasons, the introducer
of night, therefore an important cultural power, yet mischievous,
the hero of numerous folk-stories; he does not appear in animal
form but lives an ordinary family life. He is not worshiped&mdash;he
is regarded rather as the explanation of phenomena, a genuine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>product of early cosmogonic science. He appears to be the nearest
approach in Melanesia to a real creator (with the exception perhaps
of a somewhat uncertain female being called Koevasi); but alongside
of him stand a number of spirits and ancestral ghosts who
play an important part in the organization of society.<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> For the
Koryaks of Northeastern Siberia the "Big Grandfather" is an arranger
of all things out of pre&euml;xisting material;<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> the Chukchee, on
the other hand, regard as creator a benevolent being residing in
the zenith. Vague stories of simitar arrangers are found among the
East African Nandi, and the South African Zulus.<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_641" id="p_641">641</a></b>. Traces of this function of organizing society appear in the
mythical figures of some higher religions. Among such figures may
be reckoned the Babylonian Gilgamesh, the Old Testament Cainides,
the Greek Heracles, Theseus, Orpheus, and others.<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a> But
these personages generally take on human form and are treated as
factors in the regular social development.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_642" id="p_642">642</a></b>. The "culture-hero" thus seems to be a natural product of
incipient civilization. He represents the vague feeling that the institutions
of society arose out of human needs and that the origination
of these institutions demanded more than human wisdom and
power.<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> He partakes of the nature of both men and gods&mdash;he is
all-powerful, yet a creature of caprice and a slave of accident. To
him society is supposed to owe an incalculable debt; but his mixed
nature affords a wide field for bizarre myths and folk-stories, and
he of necessity gives way to more symmetrical divine figures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span><b><a name="p_643" id="p_643">643</a></b>. The god, in the true sense of the word, is the highest generalization
of the constructive religious imagination. In his simplest
and earliest form he appears as a venerable supernatural man, wise
according to the wisdom of his place and time&mdash;such is the natural
conception of the lower tribes. His position is described by the
titles "the old one," "the father," "the grandfather";<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a> he is a
superhuman headman or chief, caring for his people, giving them
what they need, sharing their ethical ideas and enforcing their ethical
rules. He is an all-sufficient local ruler or overseer, his functions
touching the whole life of his people and of no other people. In
the progress of myth-making (that is, in the construction of early
scientific theology) such gods are not infrequently represented as
men who have gone up to the sky; this is a natural way of accounting
for their superterrestrial abode. Savage conceptions of
the origin and history of such figures are usually vague, and their
theologies fluctuating and self-contradictory; but there are two
points as to which opinion is firm: the god is like men in everything
except power, and his functions are universal. He represents
not a monotheistic creed (which takes the whole world as the domain
of God), but a narrow tribal acceptance of the sufficiency of
the local divine patron.<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Clan Gods</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_644" id="p_644">644</a></b>. The character just described is that of the earliest known
gods; it is embodied in certain figures found in various parts of
the world. Such divine figures belong to the simplest form of
social organization, the clan; it is in the clan that they are shaped,
and they reflect the conceptions, political and ethical, of the clan.
In Southeast Australia the personages called Daramulun, Baiame,
Bunjil, correspond to this description: they are supernatural old
men who have always existed; they are taken for granted without
inquiry into their origin; they direct the affairs of the tribe in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>general way in accordance with the moral ideas of the place and
time.<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> The Australians have other beings with vaguely expressed
characters and functions, but our information regarding these is so
meager that it is not possible to form a distinct judgment of their
character. Similar figures are the Klamath Indian "Old Man"<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a>
and the Zulu Unkulunkulu, an old man, the father of the people,
only dimly understood by the natives who have been questioned
on this point; they are uncertain whether he is dead or alive, but
in any case he is revered as a great personage.<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_645" id="p_645">645</a></b>. Other such deities are reported in South Africa, as the
Qamata of the Xosa, Morimo of the Bakuana, and farther north
Molungu.<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> On the West Coast also, in Ashanti, Dahomi, and
Yoruba, a number of deities exist which were in all probability
originally local.<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> Such appears to be the character of certain gods
of the non-Aryan tribes of India, as the Kolarian Sunthals and
Koles.<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> Perhaps also the god Vetala was originally such a local
deity with the savage characteristics proper to the time and place,
though later he was half Brahmanized and became a fiend.<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> Among
the Todas every clan has its god, who was the creator and instructor
of the people. The large number of gods now recognized
by the various Toda communities are essentially the same in character
and function, and the existing system has doubtless been
formed by the coalition of the clans.<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> In North America the
Navahos have a number of local deities, the <i>yei</i> (Zu&ntilde;i, <i>yeyi</i>), some
of which are called by terms that mean 'venerable.'<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> The Koryak
guardians of occupations and houses may be of the nature of such
objects of worship in the clans,<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> and so also the Patagonian family-gods.
Cf. the Greek &#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#8057;&#966;&#959;&#962;. In Japan the early system of
supernatural beings has been obscured by the great religions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>the later time&mdash;Shinto in its developed form, and Buddhism&mdash;but
the indications are that the general term <i>kami</i>, a designation
of all supernatural things, included local deities.<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_646" id="p_646">646</a></b>. It is not clear how early the practice began of giving
these beings proper names. In the lowest known tribes we meet
descriptive titles such as "old one," "grandfather," "grandmother";
and so among some civilized peoples, as the Semites,
whose local deities are often known simply as <i>baals</i> ('possessors,'
'lords'), sometimes as lords of particular places, as, for example,
the Arabic Dhu ash-Shara (Dusares), 'lord of the Shara.' A god
identified with a particular object may be called by its name;
so 'Heaven' is said to have become the proper name of a Huron
deity (cf. Zeus, Tien, Shangti).<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> Names of Pawnee gods are
Bright Star (Evening Star), Great Star (Morning Star), Motionless
One (North Star), and many other such; the Navahos have
The Woman Who Changes (apparently the changing year), White
Shell Woman, Child of Water;<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> the Kolarian Sunthals, Great
Mountain;<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> the Brazilian Arawaks, River-born.<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> A proper name
becomes necessary as soon as definite social relations with a god
are established. Divine names in civilized religions, of remote
origin, are often inexplicable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_647" id="p_647">647</a></b>. Among the simple clan gods divinized men should be
included. In many parts of the world, as is remarked above,
chiefs and other great personages are regarded as divine; this
attribution of divinity is a part of that general early conception
according to which there was an element of power in all things,
naturally embodied in a special way in important men. This sort
of divinization is particularly prominent in Melanesia and parts of
Polynesia; it exists also in Japan and in West Africa. As a rule
it is only the recently dead that are thus regarded as divine objects
of worship, and the cult would thus be substantially a part
of the worship of ancestors; but such divinized men frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>bore a peculiarly intimate relation to the clan or community and
became specific protectors.<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> So far as their origin is concerned,
this class of divine patrons differs essentially from the old clan
god, whose genesis probably belongs to a remote antiquity and is
based on the general consciousness of some powerful influence in
nature.<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_648" id="p_648">648</a></b>. Clan gods are found abundantly among the ancient civilized
peoples, Egyptian, Babylonian, Canaanite, Arabian, Greek,
Roman, and probably existed among other peoples as to whom
we have no exact information. In Old Egypt every hamlet had
its protecting deity; these continued to be the objects of popular
worship down to a very late time, the form of the deity being
usually that of a living animal.<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_649" id="p_649">649</a></b>. A similar religious constitution obtained among the old
Semitic peoples. This is obvious in the case of the Canaanites
(including the Ph&oelig;nicians), where every clan or community had
its divine lord (the Baal), who was a universal deity sufficient for
all the needs of the living, though particularly connected with the
dominant interests of his people.<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> Such, probably, was the original
form of the Hebrew Yahweh (Jehovah); in his Sinaitic home he
was naturally connected with the phenomena of desert and mountain,
and in Canaan, whither the Israelites brought his cult, he
was after a while recognized as the giver of crops also, and gradually
became a universal god in the larger sense of the term.<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a>
The Ph&oelig;nician Baals&mdash;such as the Tyrian Melkart, 'the king of
the city'&mdash;are obviously local deities.<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> The same thing is true
of the various gods that appear in pre-Mohammedan Arabia; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>deity of any particular clan or tribe was known to the people as
"the god" (Arabic <i>Allah</i>, that is, <i>al-Ilahu</i>), and the title "Allah,"
adopted by Mohammed as the name of the supreme and only god,
thus in so far fitted in with the usage of the people.<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_650" id="p_650">650</a></b>. In Babylonia also a very large part of the divine names
found in the inscriptions must be understood to refer ultimately
to local deities, each supreme in his own territory; the later theologians
(probably priests) endeavored to organize these into a sort
of pantheon, but never succeeded in differentiating the various
deities distinctly. In general it may be said that all these old
Semitic gods had one and the same character; each in his place
was supreme, and it is difficult to find any difference in real character
and function among the great gods, as Ea, Bel, Marduk,
Sin, Shamash, Ishtar, Nabu, Ashur, Eshmun, and others.<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_651" id="p_651">651</a></b>. The same remark will probably hold good of the popular
worship of the old Greeks. When Pausanias traveled through
Greece he found everywhere local cults which bore evidence of
primitiveness, and obviously pertained to the clan gods of the
various regions. In many cases these had been identified with
old animal-gods or had been interwoven into the general later
scheme and had been merged with the great gods of the developed
pantheon.<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> The functions ascribed to various deities in the Veda
suggest a similar origin for them. When we find that many of
them are credited with the same larger or smaller acts of creation,
protection, or blessing, we may suspect that they were originally
clan gods that have been incorporated in the great theologic system,
and that "henotheism" is mainly a survival from this earlier
scheme or an extension of it.<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> Similar local gods appear in Peru<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span><b><a name="p_652" id="p_652">652</a></b>. One class of <i>Greek "heroes"</i> may be considered as belonging
in the category of clan gods.<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> When the hero appears to be originally
a god his worship is identical in character with that offered to
local deities; so in the case of Achilles and many others.<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> Such an
one is often a divine patron of a definite (usually small) territory,
has his sacred shrine with its ministers, and his specific sacrificial
cult. A trace of this type may perhaps be recognized in Hesiod's
"halfgods,"<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> the heroes of the Trojan war and others, whom he
places just after the age of bronze and just before his modern age
of iron; their origin is thus made relatively late, as was natural if
they descended culturally from old gods.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_653" id="p_653">653</a></b>. A similar view appears in the fact that a hero is sometimes
of mixed parentage&mdash;his father or his mother is divine: a local
god, standing in close cultic connection with a greater deity, is
easily made into a son of the latter. In general, in the popular
worship there seems to be no distinction between old heroes and
gods. Where such a hero stood in close relations with a community&mdash;if,
for example, as was sometimes the case, he was the patron
or tutelary divinity of a family, or a mythical ancestor&mdash;there was
doubtless a peculiar tenderness in the feeling for him. But his
general function probably was simply that of local patron.<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_654" id="p_654">654</a></b>. Clan gods are specially important in the history of worship&mdash;they
form the real basis of the great theistic development.
Ghosts and spirits continue to be recognized and revered or
dreaded, but they are not powerful social bonds&mdash;it is the local
deity about whose person organized public worship grows up, and
it is he whose functions are gradually enlarged till he becomes a
universal god. The initial forms of religion are everywhere limited
locally and intellectually; it is only by loyalty to the home as a
center and standing-place that man's religious affections and ideals
have expanded so as to embrace the world, and reach a high
standard of ethical purity and logical consistency.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Departmental Gods</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_655" id="p_655">655</a></b>. It must be regarded as an advance in religious conceptions
and religious life when natural phenomena are divided into classes
and assigned each to its special deity; such a scheme brings men
into more intimate and sympathetic relations with the gods. It presupposes
a relatively advanced observation of nature and some
power of co&ouml;rdination and generalization, and seems to be found
only in communities that have some well-organized communal life.
In general it belongs to the agricultural stage and to the higher
civilizations that have grown out of this stage. Care for food appears
to be the starting-point; later, all sorts of social interests
demand consideration.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_656" id="p_656">656</a></b>. This specialization of functions is possibly in part an elevation
of the old scheme of spirits according to which every object
in the world was conceived of as inhabited or controlled by some
spiritlike being. It is not probable that the departmental gods are
always developed directly out of spirits&mdash;they appear sometimes
to belong rather in the clan system, are anthropomorphic, human,
lending themselves more readily than spirits do to human intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a>
It is true that the lower cults of animals and spirits persist
alongside of the higher religious forms, and the various groups
often appear to blend with one another, as is generally the case in
transitions from one system of thought to another.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_657" id="p_657">657</a></b>. Deities with this sort of specialized functions appear in all
parts of the world and at various periods of culture. The particular
sort of specialization differs according to climatic conditions and
social organization&mdash;that is, it depends in any community on the
nature of the phenomena that touch the life of the community
closely. But the general principle remains the same&mdash;it is the effort
to penetrate more deeply into the nature of the supernatural Powers,
and to enter into more intimate and helpful relations with them; it
is the beginning of a more practical study of theology proper.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_658" id="p_658">658</a></b>. A somewhat low and vague form of specialization of function
is found in Melanesia, where certain beings appear as patrons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>of work.<a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> These are said by Codrington to be ghosts, yet to be
prayed to just as if they were gods; and in fact, being men with
indefinitely great powers, they can hardly be distinguished from
such deities as Daramulun and Unkulunkulu, except in the fact that
their function is specific. In Australia the published reports do not
describe departmental gods proper, with the possible exception of
an undefined being in the North. A more developed scheme exists
in Polynesia. In New Zealand there were deities of food-planting
and of forests.<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> The highest point of Polynesian civilization seems
to have been reached in the Hawaiian Islands, where, besides several
great gods, there were deities of the sky, the sea, winds, and lightning,
of agriculture, and of various occupations and professions,
such as fishing, and even robbing.<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_659" id="p_659">659</a></b>. The Sea Dyaks have a god of rice-farming and one of
war.<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> In the Malay Peninsula there is a confused mingling of
supernatural beings of various sorts, with a great development
of magic; the determination of the functions of the better-developed
gods is rendered difficult by the fact that the Malays have been
much affected by Hindu influence.<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> Such influence is possibly to
be recognized also in the systems of the Dravidian and Kolarian
tribes, though in them there seems to be a native non-Aryan element.
The Khonds have gods of rain, fruit, hunting, and boundaries.
Among all these tribes the chief deity is the sun-god, by whose
side stands the earth-god; these may well be primitive, though their
present form may be due to Hindu influence.<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_660" id="p_660">660</a></b>. The Masai of Eastern Africa have two chief gods&mdash;one
black, said to be good; the other red, said to be bad.<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a> The only

not clear that they recognize a god of the sky and one of the earth.
Among the Bantu, who are largely, though not wholly, pastoral, there
appears to be no trace of an apportionment of natural phenomena
among supernatural beings.<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> On the West Coast of Africa there is
a somewhat elaborate scheme of departmental deities. The sky is the
chief god, but in Dahomi and Ashanti there are gods of lightning,
fire, the ocean, the rainbow, war, markets, silk, cotton, and poison
trees, smallpox, sensual desire, discord, and wisdom; in Dahomi
there is a tutelary god of the royal family. The Yorubans have a
similar system, embracing gods of the Niger, nightmare, wealth,
gardens, and divination.<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> This more elaborate system corresponds
to their more highly developed scheme of social organization.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_661" id="p_661">661</a></b>. The tribes of Northeastern Asia are less developed religiously.
The Koryaks are said to have benevolent and malevolent
deities, but appear not to have made much progress in the recognition
of the distinct departments of nature.<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> The Ainu have a large
number of specific deities: the goddess of fire, whose title is
"Grandmother"; gods of the kitchen, of doors, of springs, and of
gardens.<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> As the Ainu culture resembles that of Northeastern
Asia in several respects, it is possible that in the latter region there
exists a more highly specialized scheme than has yet been reported.
In Central Asia also it seems that no great progress has been made
in this direction by native thought. The statement of Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a>
that the Thracians in time of thunderstorms used to shoot arrows
at the sky and threaten the god, may point to a recognition of a god
of the sky or of storm. In the greater part of Central Asia the
conception of local spirits has prevailed and still prevails (Shamanism),
a phase of religion that stands below that of the division of
nature into departments. In certain districts of Mongolia, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>the theistic system is complicated, departmental deities are now
found, but the obvious dependence of this region on Buddhism
(Lamaism) and other outside cults makes it doubtful whether or
how far this scheme of gods is of native origin.<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_662" id="p_662">662</a></b>. In North America the Algonkin and Maskoki nations and
the Skidi Pawnee have deities of the sky, the heavenly bodies, the
winds, and fire.<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> In the western part of the continent the theistic
systems are less developed, but the details of the cults have not yet
been fully collected; so far as appears, a departmental organization
has not been made. In Brazil there is a trace of such a conception
among the Tupis; but the South American tribes remain at a low
level of theistic development.<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_663" id="p_663">663</a></b>. The three greater religions of America, the Maya, the Mexican,
and the Peruvian, offer much more interesting material, in regard
to which the information which has been handed down to us is
often unfortunately meager. Particularly, little definite is known of
the Maya system; the indications are that the Mayas were superior
in civilization to the Aztecs, and their religious customs and conceptions
correspondingly higher than those of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_664" id="p_664">664</a></b>. The Aztec religion is that which the Spaniards on their
arrival found to be the dominant one in Mexico. It was the religion
of a conquering race, formed in part by a coalition of tribes
and a combination of cults. From the records (none of which are
contemporaneous) it appears that there was a very considerable
specialization of function in the Aztec deities. These were probably
local gods with universal functions gradually differentiated. Huitzilopochtli,
apparently a patron of vegetation (with three annual festivals
corresponding to agricultural seasons), became especially
the god of war, in accordance with the character of the Aztecs.
Another side of social life was embodied in the conception of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>Tezcatlipoca, who represented law and justice, but naturally became
also a god of war. In sharp contrast with these stands
Quetzalcoatl, a milder god, apparently a representative of general
culture and good life. But he is commonly held to be of foreign
origin. If a foreigner, he was nevertheless adopted by the Aztecs
and embodied one side of their life, particularly, perhaps, the protests
against the human sacrifices, which were so prominent a
feature in the cults of the other two deities. There were further
a god of rain, a goddess of harvest, and a goddess of sensual pleasure,
besides a great number of minor specialized deities. With this
specialization of function, however, there was no corresponding
development of character in the gods, no pantheon proper. The
myths which have been preserved relate to the origin of social customs
and to the birth of gods. They appear to have been developed
only a step beyond the myths of the Redmen.<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_665" id="p_665">665</a></b>. The Peruvian cult differs from the Mexican in that it
recognizes, in its developed form, one pre&euml;minent deity, the sun-god,
from whom issues all authority. Along with him stand two
prominent figures, Viracocha and Pachacamac, who also are credited
with great powers. Apparently they were local universal deities
who were incorporated into the Peruvian system and subordinated
to the sun-god. All three are only vague, general figures, having
no histories except a few stories of origins, and the Peruvian myths
do not differ in essential character from those of the Aztecs.<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_666" id="p_666">666</a></b>. In this category we may include a large number of minutely
specialized deities of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans. As
among some lower tribes already referred to, so here many common
objects and pursuits are regarded as being under the fostering care
of specific deities. In Egypt the ripe ear of the grain, the birth of
a child and its naming, and other things had their special divinities.<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span><b><a name="p_667" id="p_667">667</a></b>. The Greeks had such divine patrons of the corncrib, beans,
plowshare, cattle, city walls, banquets, potters, physicians, athletic
contests, and even one hero known as the "frightener of horses"
and a deity called the "flycatcher."<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_668" id="p_668">668</a></b>. The Romans carried out this specialization in even greater
detail. Almost every object and every event of the communal life
had its patron deity: the house, the hearth, the field, the boundary
stone, sowing and reaping, the wall, breath, marriage, education,
death; the Lares were the special protectors of the house or of
the field, and all patrons of the home were summed up under the
general designations <i>dii penates</i> and <i>dii familiares</i>. Most of these
beings have proper names, but even where there are no such names,
as in the case of the <i>dii penates</i>, there can be little doubt that they
were looked on as personal individualized beings.<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a> The tendency
was, as time went on, to add to the number of these specialized
patrons, as appears from the Roman <i>indigitamenta</i><a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> lists of such
divine beings redacted by the priests, who were disposed, naturally,
to make the objects of worship as numerous as possible; but herein
they doubtless responded to a popular impulse.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_669" id="p_669">669</a></b>. This disposition to define practical functions minutely appears
also in the cultic history of the greater gods of the old Roman
religion: the r&ocirc;le of Jupiter as god of sky and rain was definitely
fixed, and Tellus was not the divine mother of the human race but
the beneficent bestower of crops. As the functions of such greater
gods became more numerous and more definitely fixed, epithets were
employed; Jupiter had a dozen or more of such adjectival additions,
and it appears that at a later time such epithets were personalized
into deities; but this academic or priestly procedure does not set
aside the fact that the early Roman religion recognized a vast number
of divine beings as the specific patrons of certain things and acts.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_670" id="p_670">670</a></b>. It was quite natural for the practical Roman mind to place
everything of importance under the care of a divine being&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>procedure which is simply carrying out in greater detail modes of
thought which we have seen to be common in many of the lower
tribes. Augustine thinks this specialization amusing, ridiculous, and
difficult to understand. He brings up the whole question of origin
when he asks why it was necessary to have two goddesses for the
waves of the sea&mdash;one, Venilia, representing the wave as advancing
to the shore; the other, Salacia, representing the wave as receding.<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a>
This seems, to be sure, an unnecessary specialization; but, considered
in connection with the whole Roman system, it is not less
intelligible than the multiplication of deities attending upon the
birth and education of a child, on the processes of farming, and on
the fortunes of war. Since human life is guided by the gods,
thought the Romans, there is no act that may not have its god;
this system is the objectivation of the conception of divine special
providence.<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_671" id="p_671">671</a></b>. To certain Semitic deities highly specialized functions have
been supposed to belong; but the known facts hardly warrant this
supposition. In the names Baal-Marqod, Baal-Marpe, Baal-Gad,
the second element may be the name of a place; that is, the Baal
may be a local deity (as the Baals elsewhere are). The title Baal-berit<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a>
has been interpreted as meaning "lord of a covenant"&mdash;that
is, a deity presiding over treaties; but the expression is not clear.
Baalzebub is in the Old Testament the god of the Philistine city
Ekron, where he had a famous oracle;<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> it is highly improbable that
the name means "lord of flies" (which would rather be Baal-zebubim),
but the sense is obscure. The New Testament Baal [Beel]-zebul<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a>
(the only correct form) has been variously explained.
The second element, <i>zebul</i>, occurs in the Old Testament as a name
of the heavenly abode of the deity,<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> and the title has been regarded
as the Semitic rendering of a Greek or Roman title of a god of
heaven (Zeus Ouranios; cf. Caelestis, epithet of Jupiter); as foreign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>deities were called "demons" by the later Jews, the chief of these
deities, it is held, might well be taken to be the "prince of demons."
However this may be, Beelzebul cannot be ranked among the deities
with highly specialized functions.<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_672" id="p_672">672</a></b>. The scheme of gods just described is closely allied to that
of tutelary deities for individual human beings. A transitional step
may be recognized in the assignment of special divine protectors
to every house or village or grove, as among the Ainu (with whom
the tutelary power is the head of a bear), in Borneo (where every
house has a human skull as protector), among the Khonds, in the
Vedic Vastoshpati, the "lord of the house," in the Hindu "house
goddess," and in the Chinese tutelary god for every year.<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> From
such a scheme to the assignment of a protecting spirit to every
human being there is but a step, and this is made natural or necessary
by the increasing sense of the value of the individual. Such
tutelary spirits or deities are found in Polynesia and Africa.<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> The
North American manitu and the Central American nagual,<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> referred
to above, are not only special objects of worship but also constantly
present guardians of individual men. The Iroquois have special
tutelary spirits.<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> In Ashanti such a function is performed by the
indwelling spirit, which is scarcely distinguishable from the man
himself.<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> The Roman <i>genius</i> represents the man's individual life,
but becomes also his guardian;<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> and the <i>daimon</i> of Socrates was
possibly originally a being of the same sort,<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> though he may have
identified it with conscience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span><b><a name="p_673" id="p_673">673</a></b>. In the great religions of antiquity every city and every state
had its special divine protector. The Persian fravashis are the
guardians of individual human beings. The later Jews held that
there was a guardian angel for every nation and for every person.<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a>
All such conceptions embody the human sense of dependence on
divine aid and the demand for specific divine protectors standing
near to man and sustaining special relations with individuals. In
some forms of Christianity the function of protection is assigned to
patron saints.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_674" id="p_674">674</a></b>. Certain classes of departmental or specific gods may be
mentioned here for the purpose of indicating their development.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_675" id="p_675">675</a></b>. <i>Creators.</i> The work of the creation of the world is assigned
among various peoples to a great variety of beings. In the earliest
strata of religious belief animals play a great r&ocirc;le as creators. The
known examples of their creative function are so numerous that
we may well be disposed to regard it as universal. In general it
is the best-known animal, or the one credited with the greatest
sagacity, that is regarded as creator.<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_676" id="p_676">676</a></b>. But the natural progress of thought involved the advance to
the conception of anthropomorphic creators. A transitional stage
is presented by the Australian Arunta, in whose mythical system
the authors of tribal institutions and the makers of heavenly
bodies are the half-animal, half-human ancestors; this seems to be
an attempt at a transformation of the old scheme of creation by
animals&mdash;unwilling to abandon the earlier conception, these tribes
have satisfied themselves by the theory that the ancestors and
creators, though animals in nature, must at the same time have
been human.<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> We may compare with these the Melanesian and
Samoan supernatural beings who are incarnate in animal forms and
are at the same time originators of civilization.<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> These zo&ouml;morphic
beings are not necessarily totems, as in Australia; outside of the
Arunta it does not appear that totems as such are ever regarded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>as creators<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a>&mdash;they are ancestors, but at that point their function

<p><b><a name="p_677" id="p_677">677</a></b>. There are however ghosts, which, while of course representing
ancestors, are regarded not specially in their ancestorial
capacity, but rather as powerful beings who have been more or
less active in framing the constitution of society. This form of
ghost occurs in Melanesia, where also spirits, vague beings who
never were human, play a great r&ocirc;le. The best authorities find it
somewhat difficult to distinguish between such ghosts and spirits
on the one hand, and gods on the other hand.<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> The Qat of the
Banks Islands is in one sense a creator, since he determines the
regular courses of the seasons and is the introducer of night; yet,
since he does not actually create the world, but only rearranges the
existing material, he belongs rather in the category of transformers
or initiators. Real anthropomorphic gods appear as creators in
very early tribes. Such, for example, are Baiame, Daramulun, Bunjil
of Australia,<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> perhaps Supu of the Melanesian island of Vate.</p>

Heaven and Earth, whose children are the producers of all things

<p><b><a name="p_679" id="p_679">679</a></b>. The great civilized nations, with their well-formed anthropomorphic
deities, have constructed elaborate cosmogonies, which
commonly begin with the conception of an unshaped mass of
material out of which the gods arise and create the world. There
is no great difference in these various schemes: Babylonians and
Greeks have fallen upon substantially the same general view of
creation; the variations among the various peoples are due to circumstances
of place and culture. It is noteworthy that the Maoris
have a cosmogony which is not unlike that of the great civilized
nations of antiquity, but the origin of their scheme of the world is
not clear.<a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_680" id="p_680">680</a></b>. <i>Gods of the other world.</i> The class of departmental
gods includes those who have charge of the other world. As soon
as the abode of men after death is definitely fixed, it is natural
that a deity presiding over this other world should arise. Among
the lower tribes this sort of god is not frequent.<a name="FNanchor_1156" id="FNanchor_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> One of the
clearest cases of such organization occurs in Fiji.<a name="FNanchor_1157" id="FNanchor_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> Here, in addition
to other deities who deal with the dead on their entrance into

one of his functions is to pass on the merits of those who present
themselves from the world of living men. He is, however, in part
an otiose deity and can hardly be said to rule over this otherworldly
realm. Similar undeveloped deities are found among the
Maoris and the Finns.<a name="FNanchor_1158" id="FNanchor_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_681" id="p_681">681</a></b>. But fully formed and effective divine rulers of the other

Roman.<a name="FNanchor_1159" id="FNanchor_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a> From the nature of their abode such deities have very
little to do with the life on earth except when, as in the Egyptian
system and to some extent in the Fijian, there is a judge of conduct,
with authority to assign the dead their places, good or bad.
In such cases they become important moral factors in life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_682" id="p_682">682</a></b>. An ethical god of the other world appears not to have
been created by the Semites. The Babylonian Underworld goddess
or god has nothing to do with moral character, and among
the Hebrews, so far as the statements in the Old Testament go,
no special deity was assigned to the other world; whether such
an Underworld deity once existed and was lost by the Hebrews,
or has been expurged by the later editors of the Old Testament
books, must remain uncertain;<a name="FNanchor_1160" id="FNanchor_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> in the late pre-Christian period the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>national god, Yahweh, was regarded as controlling the Underworld
as well as Heaven and Earth.<a name="FNanchor_1161" id="FNanchor_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a> The Greek A&iuml;des or Plout&#333;n
and the Roman Pluto also are not ethical gods in the higher sense,
as indeed no early deity of any people has such a moral character.
At a later period ethical distinctions were introduced into the administration
of the other world.</p>

<p>By reason of paucity of data it is difficult to determine the precise
characters of various Celtic, Slavic, and Germanic deities
whose names appear in the records. They are gods of clans and
of departments of nature; none of them can properly be reckoned
among the great gods.<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_683" id="p_683">683</a></b>. <i>Division into good and bad Powers.</i> Among many savage
and half-civilized peoples we find that a distinction is recognized
between good and bad ghosts and spirits&mdash;a distinction at first
vague, based on passing experiences in which all the fortunes of
men, favorable and unfavorable, are referred to these beings.
Their morals are those of the human communities with which
they are connected: they may be amiable or malignant, beneficent
or revengeful, but the ethical element in their characters and deeds
is not distinctly recognized and is not made the basis of the distinction
between the two classes. The world is seen to be full of
Powers that make for weal or for woe&mdash;a conception that contains
the germ of all the later development but is at first nebulous.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_684" id="p_684">684</a></b>. In a somewhat higher form of culture these two classes
of Powers may be unified respectively into, or replaced by, two
gods, one helpful, the other harmful. Such appears to be the
scheme of the Masai, who have their black god and red god.<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> A
Californian cosmogonic myth describes a nonmoral conflict of
work between the good "Creator" and the malicious Coyote.<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>A real unification appears, however, to be rare; it supposes in
fact a degree of reflection and organization that we should not
expect to find among lower peoples. The story, for example, that
has been told of a well-developed dualistic system of the Iroquois
is based on a misconception.<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> Dualism proper is not recognizable
among the savages of America, Polynesia, Asia, or Africa.<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a>
In the Old Testament prior to the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the spirits,
good and bad, which are not essentially different from those we
find among the lower tribes, are massed under the control of
Yahweh, and do his bidding without moral reflection; when he
sends a lying spirit into the mouth of Ahab's prophets<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> this
spirit goes without malice merely to perform the will of the
supreme god. This massing of all spirit Powers under the control
of one god is a step toward unity and clearness in the conception
of the government of the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_685" id="p_685">685</a></b>. At a later stage of social growth there appears the conception
of a cosmic struggle, the conflict between the natural
forces that tend to disorder and those that tend to order. Philosophical
reflection led to the supposition of an original chaos, a
medley of natural forces not combined or organized in such a way
as to minister to the needs of human life; and a similar conception
of conflict may have arisen from observation of the warring
elements at certain seasons of the year.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_686" id="p_686">686</a></b>. The adjustment of the rival forces and the establishment
of a system of physical order is referred to the great gods. Such
a picture of the original state of things is contained in the elaborate
Babylonian cosmologies that have come down to us; in these
the dragon of disorder (Tiamat) is completely conquered by the god
Bel-Marduk, who represents the Babylonian civilization of the
time in which the cosmology arose. Of the same nature is the
Egyptian myth of the contest between Horus (the light) and Set
(the dark), in which, however, the victory of Horus is not described
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>as being absolute<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>&mdash;a representation suggested, possibly, by the
recognition of the persistence of the good and bad elements of the
world; compare the cosmologies of the Maidu and the Khonds
mentioned above (&sect;684). In the Greek and Teutonic myths in
which the Giants are the enemies of the great gods a more humane
and settled government of the world is introduced by Zeus and
Wodan. Traces of this construction of the universe are to be
found also among the Maoris, the Hawaiians, and other peoples
of a like grade.<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_687" id="p_687">687</a></b>. In the original form of these myths there is no moral element
beyond the fact that the settlement of the cosmic powers was
necessary in order to the establishment of good social life. Individual
wicked deities do not appear at this stage, but the way is prepared
for them by the picture of cosmic struggle in which powers
friendly and unfriendly to men are opposed to one another. A
similar conception is found in the figures of the Fates, who are the
embodiment of the course of events in the world&mdash;the immovable,
remorseless, absolute fortune of men, good and bad&mdash;a picture
of life as it has presented itself, doubtless, to men in all periods of
history. Out of this came the abstract conception of Fate, the
impersonal power that controls all things.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_688" id="p_688">688</a></b>. The deeper conception of a conflict between the moral good
and the moral evil in life belongs to the latest period in religious
history. Here the determining fact is the control of the world by
the high gods, who have their adversaries, but in general prove
victors. At the foundation of this scheme of the world lies the conception
of order, which is particularly defined in the Vedic <i>arta</i> and
the Avestan <i>asha</i><a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a>&mdash;the regulation of the world in accordance
with human interests, in which the ethical element becomes more
and more prominent as human society is more and more formed
on an ethical basis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span><b><a name="p_689" id="p_689">689</a></b>. Ethical dualism is most fully embodied in the Persian conception
of two gods, good and bad, with the understanding that
the good god, Ahura Mazda, exercises a certain restraint on the
bad god, Angro Mainyu, who is finally to be crushed.<a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a> This optimistic
point of view, which has no doubt existed in germinal shape
among all peoples, appears also in the modified dualism of the Old
Testament and the late Jewish and Christian schemes. The Old
Testament Satan is originally a divine being, one of the "sons of
the Elohim" (that is, he belongs to the Elohim, or divine, class); his
function is that of inspector of human conduct, prosecutor-general,
with a natural tendency to disparage men and demand their punishment.
As a member of Yahweh's court and council he makes
regular reports to his divine lord and pleads cases before the divine
court.<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a> In this character he is suspicious and mischievous but not
immoral; but a little later a trace of malice appears in him,<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> and in
the uncanonical Jewish book of the Wisdom of Solomon and in
the New Testament he advances to the position of the head of the
kingdom of moral evil, so that he is called also "the god of the
present age"<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a>&mdash;that is, he is the controller of the existing unregenerate
element in human society, and is to be displaced when
the ideal age shall be established.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_690" id="p_690">690</a></b>. <i>Man's attitude toward demons.</i> Demons<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> (the term being
taken to include all early malefic superhuman beings, whether ghosts
or spirits) are feared and guarded against, but rarely receive worship.
As they are the authors of all physical ills that cannot be
explained on natural grounds, measures, usually magical, are taken
to thwart their purposes&mdash;to prevent their intervention or to overcome
and banish the evil begun by them. As they are not credited
with moral principle, hostility to them rests not on ethical feeling
but merely on fear of suffering.<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> If they are placated, it is in cases
in which they approach the character of gods and in so far cease to
be demons in our sense of the word. They serve a useful purpose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>in that, taking on their shoulders all the ills of life, they leave the
clan gods free from the suspicion of unfriendliness to men.<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> On the
other hand, the belief in them has created a pseudo-science of relief
from suffering and a great host of pseudo-doctors who for a long
time exercised a large control over society and bound men in fetters
of ignorance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_691" id="p_691">691</a></b>. In early societies demons have not individual names. In
savage societies there are malefic deities, with individual names,
connected with sicknesses and other ills; but such deities are not
demons. Demons do not enter into friendly social relations with
men,<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a> and observation of experiences is not carried so far as to
assign every ill to a separate author. In more advanced societies,
as, for instance, the Babylonian,<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> demons are divided into classes
according to their various lines of activity, and to these classes
names are given. If some individual demon, representing a particular
ill, becomes specially important, it may receive an individual
name. In general, the demonic name-giving follows the theistic, but
lags behind it. Clan gods have at first some such appellation as
Old One, Grandfather, or a descriptive epithet (as among some
American Indian tribes), and later, Lord, Lady, Mighty One, Exalted
One; in process of time they receive proper names, which must have
arisen at a relatively early period, since the meaning of the names
of most of the old deities was to the ancients, as it is to us, unknown.
In the case of the demonic world this development has not been
carried so far, for the reason stated above, namely, that these
beings, unlike gods, have not become real citizens of the communities
with which they are connected.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_692" id="p_692">692</a></b>. In like manner the organization of demons has not kept
pace with that of gods. In most regions they have remained a
mob, every individual pursuing his way independently. It is only in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>advanced cults that they form a community with a head. In China
and Persia the sharp division of supernatural forces into two classes
was the outcome of great religious reformations that followed the
usual savage chaos of the hordes of demons. The Jewish demonology
(probably influenced by the Persian) chose for the head of its
kingdom of evil an old god (the Satan) or the similar figure Azazel.<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_693" id="p_693">693</a></b>. It does not appear that religious worship has ever been
offered to a being regarded as morally bad and in honor of moral
badness. The "devils" reported by early (and some recent)
travelers as the recipients of religious homage turn out on inquiry
to be clan gods whose anger is feared.<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a> The cult of many savage
and many civilized deities has been, and is, characterized by gross
cruelty and licentiousness; but it is certain that human sacrifice
and sexual indulgence were, and are, in these cases not regarded as
morally wrong. Durga (Kali), wife of &Ccedil;iva, most terrible and
repulsive of female deities, while she is feared, is also revered as the
giver of all good gifts; and the Thugs, when they offered her their
strangled victims, ascribed no more moral blame to her than to
themselves&mdash;their work they regarded not as murder but as pious
sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> The Gnostic sects, Ophites and Cainites, looked on the
serpent and Cain as friends of the supreme Deity and of man;
they were enemies only of the Demiourgos, the Jewish god Yahweh,
who, they held, wished to keep man in ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> The Mesopotamian
Yezidis also (the so-called devil-worshipers) revere only
beings that they regard as morally good or as destined to become
good. Their peculiar attitude toward Satan (a mingling of fear and
respect) is based not on his connection with evil but on their expectation
that, though he is now fallen from his high angelic estate, he
is ultimately to be restored to his original dignity.<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span><b><a name="p_694" id="p_694">694</a></b>. Thus, it cannot be said that a demon has ever developed
into a god. The malefic Powers of savages have generally been
absorbed by higher beings or have otherwise disappeared. Some
gods, such as the Hebrew Satan and certain Greek deities, have
been degraded to the demonic class. In some cases, particularly in
the Zoroastrian system, a being who is the consolidation of all
malign supernatural activities has been credited with all-but divine
power and authority.<a name="FNanchor_1185" id="FNanchor_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> But the two classes remain distinct&mdash;the
true "god" is a friendly member of a human society, and when he
is angry may be placated; the true "demon" is essentially hostile
to men and must be thwarted and expelled.<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_695" id="p_695">695</a></b>. <i>Gods of abstractions.</i> Gods of abstractions, found in certain
theistic systems, are to be distinguished on the one hand from
deities that are simply personalizations of physical objects (such as
Vesta and Agni) and on the other hand from poetical personifications,
such as that of Wisdom in the Jewish books of Proverbs,
Ecclesiasticus, and the Wisdom of Solomon, and from concrete figures
like the Logos of Philo and the Fourth Gospel. Though these
abstract forms appear to be relatively late (posterior to the formation
of the greater gods), the meagerness of our data makes it
difficult to describe their genesis and the conceptions of their character
by the peoples among whom they arise. Some facts known
to us, however, may help us to understand in part the process by
which they came into existence.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_696" id="p_696">696</a></b>. We have already considered the tendency in human communities
to particularize the divine objects of worship and to personalize
external objects; everywhere, it would appear, there is a
disposition to assign a particular divine control to every fact that is
specially connected with human interests. We have to note, further,
the tendency to concretize, as, for example, in many cases in
which evil, physical or moral, is regarded as a concrete thing that
may be removed bodily from the community.<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> This sort of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>conception we may suppose to be connected with early psychological
theory, according to which anything that affects man is credited
with manlike form and power. The facility with which the abstract
and the concrete may be identified is illustrated by such modern
terms as deity, majesty, highness, state, government, direction,
counsel; in these expressions the abstract quality or act is incarnated
in certain persons, and so we may imagine that at a certain
stage of society any quality or act might be isolated and regarded
as a personal thing. A series of victories, for example, might suggest
the conception of 'victory' as a thing present in these events,
and the tendency to personalize would then create the divine figure
Victory. Historically a personalization may have arisen, in some
cases, through the isolation of an epithet of a deity (so, for example,
Fides may have come from Dius Fidius),<a name="FNanchor_1188" id="FNanchor_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a> but in such cases the
psychological basis of the personalization is the same as that just
stated. From these, as is remarked above, must be distinguished
poetical and philosophical abstractions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_697" id="p_697">697</a></b>. Whatever be the explanation of the process, we find in fact
a large number of cases in which such abstractions appear as deities
and receive worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_698" id="p_698">698</a></b>. <i>Semitic.</i> The material for the Semitic religions on this point
is scanty.<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> The Arabic divine names supposed by N&ouml;ldeke to represent
abstractions are Man&#257;t (fate), Sa'd (fortune), Ru&#7693;&#257; (favor),
Wadd (love), Man&#257;f (height), 'Au&#7693; (time). Whether these are all
abstract terms is doubtful. <i>Wadd</i> means also 'lover,' divine friend
or patron. <i>Sa'd</i> occurs as adjective 'fortunate,' is the appellation
of certain stars, and the god Sa'd is identified by an Arab poet
with a certain rock<a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a>&mdash;the rock is doubtless an old local divinity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span><i>Ru&#7693;&#257;</i> is found apparently only as a divine name (in Palmyrene
and Safa inscriptions and as a god of an Arabian tribe)&mdash;the form
may be concrete, in the sense of 'favoring,' divine patron. As
"time" (<i>dahr</i>, <i>zaman</i>) often occurs in Arabic poetry in the sense
of 'fate,' the god 'Au&#7693; may be an embodiment of this conception.<a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a>
<i>Man&#257;f</i>, if understood, as is possible, in the sense 'high place,' is
not abstract but concrete, though in that case the original reference
of the term is not clear.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_699" id="p_699">699</a></b>. Man&#257;t is one of the three great goddesses of Mecca, the
others being Al-L&acirc;t ('the goddess') and Al-Uzza ('the mighty one');
as these two names are concrete, there is a certain presumption that
<i>Man&#257;t</i> likewise is concrete. The original meaning of the word is
obscure. It does not occur as a common noun, but from the same
stem come terms meaning 'doom, death,'<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> and, if it be allied to
these, it would be an expression for 'fate' (like <i>'Au&#7693;</i>). However,
the stem is used in the sense 'number, determine, assign,' and
Man&#257;t may be the divine determiner of human destinies. From
this same stem comes the Biblical <i>Meni</i>, and apparently the Assyrian
<i>Manu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> The ordinary North Semitic conception of the source of
human destinies is that they are determined by the gods and written
on tablets or in a book,<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a> and the same conception may have
existed in the South Semitic area.<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> The other deity mentioned in
Isaiah lxv, 11, is Gad; the word means in Arabic and Hebrew
'fortune, good fortune,' and occurs as the name of a deity in
Ph&oelig;nician and Aramaic inscriptions, but the data are not sufficient
to fix its original sense. It is the name of a Hebrew tribe, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>is perhaps so called from the tribal god, and the name of a tribal
god is probably concrete.<a name="FNanchor_1196" id="FNanchor_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_700" id="p_700">700</a></b>. It seems, then, that for most if not all of the names of the
Semitic deities just mentioned abstract senses, though possible, are
not certain. N&ouml;ldeke remarks that most of these terms are poetical&mdash;they
may be ornate epithets given to old concrete divine figures,
in which case the real cults were attached to these latter and not
to abstractions. It must be regarded as doubtful whether Semitic
religion created any abstract deity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_701" id="p_701">701</a></b>. <i>Egyptian.</i> The most prominent Egyptian abstract deity is
Maat, 'truth.' She fulfilled an important function in the judgment-hall
of Osiris in the Underworld, and was widely revered, but had
no mythical history, and seems to have been rather a quasi-philosophical
creation than a vital element of the Egyptian religious
life. A god Destiny is mentioned, who generally bestowed a
happy fate.<a name="FNanchor_1197" id="FNanchor_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_702" id="p_702">702</a></b>. <i>Roman and Greek.</i> The most fully developed form of this
conception is found in the Roman cult.<a name="FNanchor_1198" id="FNanchor_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a> The civic genius of the
Romans led them to give prominence to the maintenance of public
and private rights; thus among their deities appear public safety
or salvation (Salus Publica), public faith or fidelity to engagements
(Fides), civic harmony (Concordia), connubial purity (Pudicitia), filial
devotion (Pietas), the boundary of property (Terminus), victory
(Victoria), liberty (Libertas). There are further the gods Youth
(Juventus and Juventas) and Desire<a name="FNanchor_1199" id="FNanchor_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a> (Cupido), perhaps as things
fundamental in human life.<a name="FNanchor_1200" id="FNanchor_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a> Fortune (Fortuna) is the mass of
evidence determining life by the will of the gods, with which the
utterances of the gods (Fata) are identical, and the embodiment of
the determining agencies is the Parc&aelig;. Several of these deities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>have their correspondents in the Greek theistic system:<a name="FNanchor_1201" id="FNanchor_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> Eros
(desire); Tuche (that which is allotted one by the gods or by the
course of events); Moira (Aisa), the unification of all the powers
that determine man's destiny. The god Kronos was by some improperly
identified with "time" (&#967;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;).<a name="FNanchor_1202" id="FNanchor_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_703" id="p_703">703</a></b>. <i>Aryan.</i> Among the Aryans of India the god Kama
(desire) appears to be identical with Cupido. Some other abstractions,
such as Piety and Infinity, are akin to Mazdean conceptions.<a name="FNanchor_1203" id="FNanchor_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a>
Brahma, originally 'magical formula,' then 'prayer,' and
later 'pious thought,' becomes finally Brahma, the all-embracing
god. &#7770;ta (arta), 'order,' at first, perhaps, the proper order of the
sacrificial ritual, becomes finally 'moral order or righteousness'
and 'cosmic order.' This conception is still more prominent in
the Avesta,<a name="FNanchor_1204" id="FNanchor_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> in which Asha (Order) is one of the Amesha-spentas,
only inferior to the supreme god; the other companions of Ahura
Mazda have similar titles and may equally be regarded as the personalization
of abstract ideas.<a name="FNanchor_1205" id="FNanchor_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a> In the same category may be included
the Mazdean conceptions Endless Time (Zrvan Akarana)
and Endless Space (Thwasha), which appear to be treated in the
Avesta as personal deities.<a name="FNanchor_1206" id="FNanchor_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a> The organizers of the Mazdean faith,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>having discarded almost all the old gods, invested the supreme
god with certain moral qualities, and these, by a natural process
of thought, were concretized (Ahura Mazda is sometimes included
in the list of Amesha-spentas). Thus arose a sort of pantheon,
an echo of the old polytheism; but the history of the process of
formulation is obscure.<a name="FNanchor_1207" id="FNanchor_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_704" id="p_704">704</a></b>. Most, if not all, of the abstract conceptions mentioned
above are also placed, in the various theistic systems, under the
control of great gods. Thus, for example, Jupiter is the guardian
of boundaries and has the epithet "Terminus," and Zeus is the
patron of freedom (Eleutherios).<a name="FNanchor_1208" id="FNanchor_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> It is, however, not necessary to
suppose that the abstractions in question are taken from the functions
of the great gods. Rather these epithets of the gods are to
be explained from the same tendency that produced gods of abstractions.
It was the sense of the importance of the boundary
in early life that led both to the creation of the god Terminus and
to the assignment of the epithet "Terminus" to Jupiter. The desire
or love that was so important an element in human life both
fashioned itself into a personality and was put under the guardianship
of a special deity. Public safety was a cherished idea of the
Romans and was doubtless held to be maintained by every local
or national god, yet could none the less become an independent
deity. The data are not sufficient to enable us to determine in all
cases the question of chronological precedence between the deification
of the abstraction and the assignment of the epithet to a
god. We know that in the later Roman period abstractions were
personalized, but this procedure was often poetical or rhetorical.<a name="FNanchor_1209" id="FNanchor_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_705" id="p_705">705</a></b>. A general relation may be recognized between the intellectual
character of a people and the extent to which it creates abstract
gods. The Semitic peoples, among whom the development
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>of such gods is the feeblest, are characterized by objectiveness
of thought, indisposition to philosophical or psychological analysis,
and a maintenance of local political and religious organization;
it is natural that they should construct concrete deities
exclusively or almost exclusively. Egypt also was objective, and
carried its demand for visible objects of worship to the point of
incarnating its gods in living animals; such living gods tend to
banish pale abstractions, and such conceptions played an insignificant
part in Egyptian religion. In India, with its genius for philosophical
refinement, we might expect to find this latter class of
gods; but Indian thought speedily passed into the large pantheistic
and other generalizations that absorbed the lesser abstractions.
Greece appears to have had the combination of philosophy and
practicalness that favors the production of a certain sort of abstract
gods, and a considerable number of these it did produce;<a name="FNanchor_1210" id="FNanchor_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a>
but here also philosophy, in the form of large theories of the constitution
and life of man, got the upper hand and repressed the
other development. The Romans had no pretensions to philosophic
or &aelig;sthetic thought, but they had a keen sense of the value
of family and civic life, and great skill in using religion for social
purposes. It is they among whom specialized deities, including
abstractions, had the greatest significance for the life of the people&mdash;family
and State.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_706" id="p_706">706</a></b>. With the growth of general culture all specialized divinities
tend to disappear, absorbed by the great gods and displaced
by better knowledge of the laws governing the bodily and mental
growth of men.<a name="FNanchor_1211" id="FNanchor_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> The divinities of abstractions, so far as they
were really alive, had the effect of making great civic and religious
ideas familiar to the people. Later (as in modern life) such ideas
were cherished as the outcome of reflection on domestic and
national relations&mdash;in the earlier period they were invested with
sacredness and with personal power to inspire and guide. Exactly
what their ethical influence on the masses was it is hardly possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>to determine; but it may be regarded as probable that they helped
to keep alive certain fundamental conceptions at a time when reflection
on life was still immature.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Nature Gods</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_707" id="p_707">707</a></b>. The term "nature gods" may be taken as designating
those deities that are distinguished on the one hand from natural
objects regarded as divine and worshiped, and on the other hand
from the great gods, who, whatever their origin, have been quite
dissociated from natural objects; in distinction from these classes
nature gods are independent deities who yet show traces of their
origin in the cult of natural objects.<a name="FNanchor_1212" id="FNanchor_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_708" id="p_708">708</a></b>. These three classes often shade into one another, and it is
not always easy to draw the lines between them. It is worth while,
however, to keep them separate, because they represent different
stadia of religious and general culture; the nature gods are found
in societies which have risen above the old crude naturalism, but
have not yet reached the higher grade of intellectual and ethical
distinctness. But as they are in a real sense dissociated from natural
objects, they tend to expand as society grows, and it is unnecessary
to attempt to deduce all their functions from the characteristics of
the objects with which they were originally connected. In some
cases, doubtless, they coalesce with the local clan gods whose
functions are universal; and in general, when a god becomes the
recognized deity of his community, the tendency is to ascribe to
him a great number of functions suggested by the existing social
conditions. In some cases the particular function of the god may
be derived from the function of the natural object whence he is
supposed to spring; but the number and variety of functions that
we often find assigned to one deity, and the number of deities
that are connected with a single function, indicate the complexity
of the processes of early religious thought and make it difficult to
trace its history in detail.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_709" id="p_709">709</a></b>. Among natural objects the heavenly bodies, sun, moon, and
stars, and particularly the sun and moon, have very generally
attracted men's attention and become objects of worship. The
deification of the sun may be traced through all stadia of development,
from the crudest objectivism to a highly developed monolatry
or a virtual monotheism.<a name="FNanchor_1213" id="FNanchor_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> Veneration of the physical sun, or a conception
of it as a supernatural man, is found in many parts of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_1214" id="FNanchor_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> It has not been observed, apparently, in Australia, Melanesia,
Indonesia, and on the North American Pacific Coast;<a name="FNanchor_1215" id="FNanchor_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> these
regions are all backward in the creation of gods&mdash;devoting themselves
to the elaboration of social organization they have contented
themselves largely with an apparatus of spirits and divine animals.
In Central and Northern Asia and among the Ainu of Jesso, while
there appears to be a recognition of the sun as divine, it is difficult to
distinguish real solar divinities.<a name="FNanchor_1216" id="FNanchor_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a> In Japan mention is made of a sun-goddess
but she plays an insignificant part in the religious system.<a name="FNanchor_1217" id="FNanchor_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_710" id="p_710">710</a></b>. The cult is more developed in Eastern and Central North
America, particularly in the former region. The Navahos (in the
center of the continent) have a vague deity of the sun, but the cult
is most prominent among the Algonkin (Len&acirc;p&eacute;) and Natchez
tribes; the last-named especially have an elaborate cult in which the
sun as deity seems to be distinct from the physical form.<a name="FNanchor_1218" id="FNanchor_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_711" id="p_711">711</a></b>. The highest development of this cult in America was
reached in Mexico and Peru. In both these countries, which had
worked out a noteworthy civilization, the solar cult became supreme,
and in Peru it attained an ethical and universalistic form which
entitles it to rank among the best religious systems of the lower
civilized nations.<a name="FNanchor_1219" id="FNanchor_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span><b><a name="p_712" id="p_712">712</a></b>. The Egyptians, with their more advanced civilization, finally
carried sun-worship to a very high point of perfection. The
hymns to Ra, the sun-god, reached the verge of monotheism and
are ethically high, yet traces of the physical side of the sun appear
throughout.<a name="FNanchor_1220" id="FNanchor_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a> The same thing is true of the old Semitic sun-cult.
The Babylonian and Assyrian Shamash is in certain respects an
independent deity with universal attributes, but retains also some
of the physical characteristics of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_1221" id="FNanchor_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> In Africa, outside of
Egypt, the only trace of an independent sun-god appears to be in
Dahomi, where, however, he is not prominent; why such a god
should not be found in the neighboring countries of Ashanti and
Yoruba is not clear; climatic conditions would affect all these
countries alike.<a name="FNanchor_1222" id="FNanchor_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_713" id="p_713">713</a></b>. In the Veda the sun-god Savitar has a very distinguished
position as ethical deity, but earlier than he the similar figure Surya
represents more nearly the physical sun, and this is true perhaps
also of Mitra.<a name="FNanchor_1223" id="FNanchor_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> With the latter it is natural to compare the Avestan
Mithra; he is held by some to have been originally a god of light,
but he seems also to have characteristics of the sun in the Avesta,<a name="FNanchor_1224" id="FNanchor_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a>
and in late Persian the word <i>mihr</i> ('sun') indicates that he was at
any rate finally identified with the sun. It is noteworthy that a distinct
sun-worship is reported among certain non-Aryan tribes of
India, particularly the Khonds;<a name="FNanchor_1225" id="FNanchor_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> this cult may be compared with
that of the Natchez mentioned above,<a name="FNanchor_1226" id="FNanchor_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> though the Khonds are less
socially advanced than these American tribes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_714" id="p_714">714</a></b>. The cultic history of the moon is similar to that of the
sun, but in general far less important. In addition to its charm
as illuminer of the night, it has been prominent as a measurer of
time&mdash;lunar calendars appear among many tribes and nations,
uncivilized (Maoris, Hawaiians, Dahomi, Ashanti and Yorubans,
Nandi, Congo tribes, Bantu, Todas, and others) and civilized
(the early Babylonians, Assyrians, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>perhaps the early Egyptians, and now all Mohammedan peoples).
Naturally it has been associated with the sun in myths, standing
to it in the relation of brother or sister, husband or wife. Among
existing noncivilized peoples it sometimes receives worship as a
god<a name="FNanchor_1227" id="FNanchor_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> or as connected with a god.<a name="FNanchor_1228" id="FNanchor_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> In these cases it retains to a
great extent its character as an object of nature. So the Greek
Selen&#275; and the Roman Luna, standing alongside of the lunar
gods proper, probably indicate an early imperfect deification of
the moon.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_715" id="p_715">715</a></b>. Though the stars were generally regarded, both among
savages and in ancient civilized communities, as animated (possessed
of souls), and in a sort divine,<a name="FNanchor_1229" id="FNanchor_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> instances of the deification
proper of particular stellar bodies are rare. In Egypt they were
reverenced, but apparently not worshiped.<a name="FNanchor_1230" id="FNanchor_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> The Babylonian astronomers
and astrologers began early to connect the planets with
the great gods (Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, etc.), and
stars, like other heavenly bodies, were held by them to be divine,
but a specific divinization of a star or planet does not appear in
the known literature.<a name="FNanchor_1231" id="FNanchor_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> The same thing is true of China, where,
it may be supposed, reverence for the stars was included in the
general high position assigned to Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1232" id="FNanchor_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> In the Aryan Hindu
cults stars were revered, and by the non-Aryan Gonds were worshiped,
but there is no star-god proper.<a name="FNanchor_1233" id="FNanchor_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_716" id="p_716">716</a></b>. In the Old Testament and the Apocrypha there are passages
in which stars and planets are referred to in a way that
indicates some sort of a conception of them as divine: they are
said to have fought against Israel's enemies, and in the later literature
they are (perhaps by a poetical figure of speech) identified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>with foreign deities or with angels.<a name="FNanchor_1234" id="FNanchor_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> But there is no sign of Israelite
worship offered them till the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when, on the
irruption of Assyrian cults, incense is said to have been burned
in the Jerusalem temple to the mazzalot (probably the signs of
the zodiac) and to all the host of heaven (the stars);<a name="FNanchor_1235" id="FNanchor_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> and there
is still no creation of a star-god.<a name="FNanchor_1236" id="FNanchor_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> The early Hebrews may have
practiced some sort of star-worship; there are traces of such a
cult among their neighbors the Arabs.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_717" id="p_717">717</a></b>. The Arab personal name Abd ath-thuraiya, 'servant (worshiper)
of the Pleiades,' testifies to a real cult,<a name="FNanchor_1237" id="FNanchor_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a> though how far
it involves a conception of the constellation as a true individual
deity it may be difficult to say. It has been supposed that the
pre-Islamic Arabs worshiped the planet Venus under the name
Al-Uzza,<a name="FNanchor_1238" id="FNanchor_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> but this is not certain. It is true that they worshiped
the morning star, and that ancient non-Arab writers identified the
planet with Al-Uzza because it was with this goddess that the
Roman goddess Venus was generally identified by foreigners.
But Al-Uzza was an old Arabian local deity who gradually assumed
great power and influence, and it is certain that she could not have
been originally a star. It must, therefore, be considered doubtful
whether the Arabs had a true star-god.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_718" id="p_718">718</a></b>. A well-defined instance of such a god is the Avestan
Tistrya.<a name="FNanchor_1239" id="FNanchor_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a> His origin as an object of nature appears plainly in his
functions&mdash;he is especially a rain-god, and, as such, a source of
all blessings. Alongside of him stand three less well defined stellar
Powers. The Greeks and Romans adopted from Chaldean astronomy
the nominal identification of the planets with certain gods
(their own divine names being substituted for the Babylonian);
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>this did not necessarily carry with it stellar worship,<a name="FNanchor_1240" id="FNanchor_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> but at a late
period there was a cult of the constellations.<a name="FNanchor_1241" id="FNanchor_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a></p>

<p>To some savage and half-civilized peoples the rainbow has
appeared to be a living thing, capable of acting on man's life,
sometimes friendly, sometimes unfriendly.<a name="FNanchor_1242" id="FNanchor_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> It figures largely in
myths, but is not treated as a god.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Great Gods</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_719" id="p_719">719</a></b>. Along with the deities described above there is a class of
higher gods with well-defined personalities, standing quite outside
physical nature and man, with definite characters, and humanized
in the higher sense. In contrast with the bizarre or barbarous
anthropomorphic forms of the earlier deities these have the shape
of refined humanity, capable of taking part in the life of the best
men; they are the embodiment of a reflective conception of the
relations between men and the great world. Inchoate divine forms
of this sort may be recognized among certain half-civilized communities,
but in their full form they are found only among civilized
peoples, being indeed the product of civilization; and among such
peoples they exist in varying degrees of approach to completeness.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_720" id="p_720">720</a></b>. The process of growth from the clan deities and the nature
gods up to these higher forms may be traced with some definiteness
in the great civilized nations of antiquity. We can see that
there has been a scientific movement of separation of gods from
phenomena. There is the distinct recognition not only of the difference
between man and physical nature, but also of the difference
between phenomena and the powers that control them.<a name="FNanchor_1243" id="FNanchor_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> At the
same time there is an increasing belief in the predominance of
reason in the government of the world, and along with this a larger
conception of the greatness of the world and finally of its unity.
Artistic feeling co&ouml;perates in the change of the character of divine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>beings&mdash;the necessity of giving symmetry and clearness to their
persons, whereby they more and more assume the form of the
highest human ideals. Necessarily the ethical element advances
hand in hand with the intellectual and artistic; it becomes more and
more difficult to conceive of gods as controlled by motives lower
than those recognized by the best men.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_721" id="p_721">721</a></b>. This general progress of thought is in some cases embodied
in the conception of a succession of dynasties&mdash;one set of gods
is overthrown or succeeded by another set; the most extreme form
of the overthrow appears in the conception of the death of a
whole community of gods, but this occurs not in the form of natural
development, but only when one stadium or phase of religion is
overmastered and expelled by another.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_722" id="p_722">722</a></b>. In Babylonia the earliest pair of deities, Lakhmu and
Lakhamu, vague forms, were succeeded by a second pair, Anshar
and Kishar, somewhat less vague, and these in their turn yielded
to the more definite group represented by Ea, Bel, and Marduk&mdash;deities
who became the embodiments of the highest Babylonian
culture; in Assyria Ashur and Ishtar occupied a similar position.
In the long religious history of the Hindus many of the gods
prominent in the Veda disappear or sink into subordinate positions,
and deities at first unimportant become supreme. The Greek succession
of dynasties resembles the Babylonian. The ancient Heaven
and Earth are followed by Kronos,<a name="FNanchor_1244" id="FNanchor_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> and he is dethroned by Zeus,
who represents governmental order and a higher ethical scheme of
society. The Romans appear to have borrowed their chronology
of the gods from the Greeks: the combination of Saturnus with
Ops (who belongs rather with Consus), the identification of these
two respectively with Kronos and Rhea, and the dynastic succession
C&aelig;lus,<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> Saturnus, Jupiter, seem not to be earlier than the
Hellenizing period in Rome.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_723" id="p_723">723</a></b>. These changes, when original, may have been due partly to
the shifting of political power&mdash;the gods of a particular dominant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>region may have come into prominence and reigned for a time,
giving place then to deities of some other region which had secured
the hegemony; the history of the earliest gods lies far back in a
dim region without historical records and therefore is not to be
reconstructed definitely now. But such light as we get from literary
records of later times rather suggests that the dynastic changes
are the product of changes in the conception of the world, and these
are as a rule in the direction of sounder and more humane thought.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_724" id="p_724">724</a></b>. There is a general similarity between the great deities that
have been created by the various civilized peoples, since civilization
has been practically the same everywhere. But the gods differ
among themselves according to the special characters, needs, and
endowments of the various peoples, so that no deity can be profitably
studied without a knowledge of the physical and mental conditions
of the community in which he arose. But everywhere we find that
any one god may become practically supreme. Here again the
political element sometimes comes in&mdash;a dominant city or state
will impose its special god on a large district. There is also the
natural tendency among men to concentrate on an individual figure.
As legendary material has always gathered around particular men,
so the great attributes of divinity gather about the person of a
particular god who, for whatever reason, is the most prominent
divine figure in a given community. Such a god becomes for the
moment supreme, to the exclusion of other deities who under different
circumstances might have had similar claims to precedence;
and under favorable conditions a deity thus raised to the highest position
may maintain himself and end by becoming the sole deity of his
people and of the world. In any case such a divine figure becomes
an ideal, and thus influences more or less the life of his worshipers.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_725" id="p_725">725</a></b>. In Oriental polytheistic systems the desire to secure completeness
in the representation of divine activity shows itself in the
combination of two or more forms into a unity of action. On the
lower level we have the composite figures of Egypt and Babylonia,
congeries of bodies, heads, and limbs, human and nonhuman&mdash;the
result partly of the survival of ancient (sometimes outgrown) forms
or the fusion of local deities, partly of the imaginative collocation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
of attributes. Many compound names may be explained in this
way; in some cases they seem to arise from accidental local relations
of cults.</p>

<p>As illustrations of lines of growth in divine figures we may take
brief biographies of some of the greater gods. It is in comparatively
few cases that the development of a god's character can be
satisfactorily traced. There are no records of beginnings&mdash;we can
only make what may be judged to be probable inferences from
names, cults, and functions. The difficulty of the subject is increased
by the fact that mythologians and theologians have obscured early
conceptions by new combinations and interpretations, often employing
familiar divine figures simply as vehicles of late philosophical
ideas or some other sort of local dogmas.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_726" id="p_726">726</a></b>. <i>Egypt.</i><a name="FNanchor_1246" id="FNanchor_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> The cult of the sun in Egypt issued in the creation
of a group of solar divinities, the most important of whom are
Horus (Har or Hor) and Ra (or R&ecirc;).</p>

<p>Horus appears to have been the great god of united Egypt in
the earliest times about which we have information. The kings of
the predynastic and early dynastic periods are called "worshipers
of Horus," a title that was adopted by succeeding monarchs, who
had each his "Horus name."<a name="FNanchor_1247" id="FNanchor_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> He was also the special patron of
some small communities&mdash;a fact that has been variously interpreted
as indicating that the god's movement was from local to general
patron,<a name="FNanchor_1248" id="FNanchor_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> or that it was in the opposite direction<a name="FNanchor_1249" id="FNanchor_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a>; the former of
these hypotheses is favored by what appears elsewhere in such
changes in the positions of deities. As Horus is always connected
with light he may have been originally a local sun-god; it is possible,
however, that he was a clan god with general functions, who
was brought into association with the sun by the natural progress
of thought. In any case he became a great sun-god, but yielded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>his position of eminence to Ra. The myth of his conflict with Set,
the representative of darkness, is probably a priestly dualistic construction,
resting, perhaps, on a political situation (the struggle between
the North and the South of the Egyptian territory).<a name="FNanchor_1250" id="FNanchor_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_727" id="p_727">727</a></b>. The general development of Ra is plain, though details are
lacking. It may be inferred from his name (which means 'sun')
that he was originally the physical sun. Traces of his early crudeness
appear in the stories of his destruction of mankind, and of
the way in which Isis, by a trick, got from him his true name and,
with it, his power.<a name="FNanchor_1251" id="FNanchor_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> With the growth of his native land (Lower
Egypt) he became the great lord of the sun, and finally universal
lord;<a name="FNanchor_1252" id="FNanchor_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> his supremacy was doubtless due in part to the political importance
of On (Heliopolis), the seat of his chief shrine. What
other circumstances contributed to his victory over Horus are not
recorded; in general it may be supposed that political changes
occasioned the recedence of the latter.</p>

<p>The primacy of Ra is illustrated by the fact that Amon was identified
with him. Amon, originally the local god of Thebes,<a name="FNanchor_1253" id="FNanchor_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> became
great in the South as Ra became great in the North, rising with the
growth of the Theban kingdom. His hold on the people, and particularly
(as was natural) on the priests, is shown in a noteworthy
way by the episode of Amenhotep IV's attempt to supplant him
by establishing a substantially monotheistic cult of the sun-god
Aton; the attempt was successful only during the king's life&mdash;after
his death Amon, under the vigorous leadership of the Theban
priests, resumed his old position and maintained it until the first
break-up of the national Egyptian government. But it was Amon-Ra
that became supreme from the fourteenth century onward. The
combination of the names was made possible by the social and
political union of the two divisions of the land, and it was Ra who
gave special glory to Amon.<a name="FNanchor_1254" id="FNanchor_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span><b><a name="p_728" id="p_728">728</a></b>. A different line of growth appears in the history of Osiris&mdash;he
owed his eminence mainly to his connection with the dead.
Where his cult arose is not known; he was a very old god, possibly
prominent in the predynastic period;<a name="FNanchor_1255" id="FNanchor_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> at a later time the importance
of Abydos, the chief seat of his worship, may have added to
his reputation. But the ceremonies of his cult and the myths that
grew up about his name indicate that he was originally a deity of
vegetation, the patron of the underground productive forces of the
earth, and so, naturally, he became the lord of the Underworld,<a name="FNanchor_1256" id="FNanchor_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a>
and eventually (as ethical conceptions of life became more definite
in Egypt) the embodiment of future justice, the determiner of the
moral character and the everlasting fate of men. Why he and not
some other underground god became Underworld judge the data
do not make clear. His association with the death and revivification
of plants gave a peculiarly human character to his mythical
biography and a dramatic and picturesque tone to his cult.<a name="FNanchor_1257" id="FNanchor_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> Of
all ancient lords of the Otherworld it is Osiris that shows the most
continuous progress and reaches the highest ethical plane&mdash;a fact
that must be referred to the intense interest of the Egyptians in
the future.<a name="FNanchor_1258" id="FNanchor_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_729" id="p_729">729</a></b>. The three most prominent female deities of the Egyptian
pantheon, Hathor of Dendera, Neith (Nit, Neit) of Sais, and Isis
of Buto, exhibit one and the same type of character, and each is
occasionally identified with one of the others. Hathor was widely
worshiped, but was not otherwise especially noteworthy. The
famous inscription said to have stood in the temple of Neith at Sais
("What is and what shall be and what has been am I&mdash;my veil
no one has lifted"<a name="FNanchor_1259" id="FNanchor_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a>) seems not to be immediately connected with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>any important religious movement, though it is in keeping with the
liberal and mystical tendency of the later time. The third goddess,
Isis, had a more remarkable history. Her beginnings are obscure,
and she appears in the inscriptions later than the other two. She
may have been a local deity,<a name="FNanchor_1260" id="FNanchor_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a> brought into association with Osiris
(as his sister or his wife) through the collocation of their cults, and
thus sharing his popularity; or she may have been a late theological
creation.<a name="FNanchor_1261" id="FNanchor_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a> Whatever her origin, as early as the sixteenth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
she appears as a great magician (poisoning and healing Ra by magic
arts),<a name="FNanchor_1262" id="FNanchor_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> then (along with Osiris) as civilizer, and finally as model wife
and mother, and as serene and beneficent mistress of the land. It
was, apparently, in this last character that she became the gathering-point
for the higher religious and ethical ideas of the time, and the
central figure in a religious scheme that was widely adopted in and
out of Egypt and seemed to be a formidable rival of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_1263" id="FNanchor_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_730" id="p_730">730</a></b>. <i>India.</i> It is in India that we find the most varied and most
sweeping development in the functions and positions of deities&mdash;a
result due in part to the long-continued movement of philosophic
thought, partly to changes in the popular religious point of view
occasioned by modifications of the social life.<a name="FNanchor_1264" id="FNanchor_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a></p>

<p>The etymology of the name Varuna is doubtful, but the representation
of him in the Rig-Veda points to the sky as his original
form&mdash;he is a clear example of a sky-god who becomes universal.
Of his earliest history we have no information&mdash;in the most ancient
records he is already fully formed. In the Rig-Veda he embraces
the whole of life&mdash;he is absolute ruler and moral governor, he
punishes sin and forgives the penitent. In conjunction with Mitra
he is the lord of order.<a name="FNanchor_1265" id="FNanchor_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> Mitra, originally the physical sun, is naturally
associated with Varuna, but in the Rig-Veda occupies a generally
subordinate position, though he appears sometimes to have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>attributes of his associate; the two together embody a lofty ethical
conception. In accordance with the Hindu fondness for metaphysical
abstractions and generalizations the nature god Varuna in the
course of time yielded the primacy to Prajapati, 'lord of beings,'<a name="FNanchor_1266" id="FNanchor_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a>
who in his turn gave way to the impersonal Brahma. In the popular
cults as well as in philosophical systems Varuna sank (or perhaps
returned) to the position of patron of phenomena of nature&mdash;there
was no longer need of him.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_731" id="p_731">731</a></b>. A god of somewhat uncertain moral character is Indra,
who as a nature god is closely connected with the violent phenomena
of the air (rain, thunder, and lightning). In this relation he is
often terrible, often beneficent, but with low tastes that it is difficult
to explain. His fondness for soma, without which he attempts
nothing, is perhaps a priestly touch, a glorification of the drink that
played so important a part in the ritual; or he may herein be an
expression of popular tastes. The sensuous character of the heaven
of which he (as air-god) is lord arose doubtless in response to early
conceptions of happiness;<a name="FNanchor_1267" id="FNanchor_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> it is not unlike the paradise of Mohammed,
which is to be regarded not as immoral, but only as the embodiment
of the existing conception of happy family life. Yet Indra also
became a universal god, the controller of all things, and it was perhaps
due to his multiform human character as warrior and rain-giver<a name="FNanchor_1268" id="FNanchor_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a>
(in his victorious conflict with the cloud-dragon), and as
representative of bodily enjoyment, that he became the favorite god
of the people. It is not hard to understand why Agni, fire, should
be associated with him and share his popularity to some extent;
but the importance of fire in the sacrifice gave Agni a peculiar
prominence in the ritual.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_732" id="p_732">732</a></b>. The most curious case of transformation and exaltation is
found in the history of Soma, at first a plant whose juice was
intoxicating, then a means of ecstatic excitement, a gift to the gods,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>the drink of the gods, and finally itself a god invested with the
greatest attributes. This divinization of a drink was no doubt
mainly priestly&mdash;it is a striking illustration of the power of the
association of ideas, and belongs in the same general category with
the deification of abstractions spoken of above.<a name="FNanchor_1269" id="FNanchor_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_733" id="p_733">733</a></b>. An example of a god leaping from an inferior position to
the highest place in the pantheon is afforded by Vishnu, a nature
god of some sort, described in the early documents as traversing
the universe in three strides. Relatively insignificant in the earlier
period and in the Upanishads, he appears in the epic, and afterwards,
as the greatest of the gods, and, in the form of his avatar Krishna,
becomes the head of a religion which has often been compared with
Christianity in the purity of its moral conceptions. By his side in
this later time stands his rival &Ccedil;iva, the chief figure in a sect
or system which shared with Vishnuism the devotion of the later
Hindus. The rise of these two gods is to be referred probably to
the dissatisfaction in the later times with the phenomenal character
which still clung, in popular feeling, to the older deities. Varuna,
once supreme, sank after a while to the position of a god of rain,
and Indra, Agni, and Soma were frankly naturalistic, while the
impersonal Brahma was too vague to meet popular demands. What
the later generation wanted was a god personal and divorced from
physical phenomena, supreme, ethically high, but invested with
warm humanity. These conditions were fulfilled by Vishnu and
&Ccedil;iva, and particularly by Krishna; that is, the later thought constructed
these new deities in accordance with the demand of the
higher and the lower religious feeling of the time: the two sides of
the human demand, the genial and the terrible, are embodied, the
first in Vishnu, the second in &Ccedil;iva.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_734" id="p_734">734</a></b>. The primeval pair, Heaven and Earth, though represented
as the parents of many gods and worshiped with sacrifices, play
no great part in the Hindu religious system. Dyaus, the Sky,
never attained the proportions of the formally identical Zeus and
Jupiter. His attributes are distinctly those of the physical sky.
The higher r&ocirc;le is assigned to Varuna, who is the sky conceived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>of as a divine Power divorced from merely physical characteristics;<a name="FNanchor_1270" id="FNanchor_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a>
the mass of phenomena connected with the sky (thunder,
lightning, and such like) are isolated and referred to various
deities. Prithivi, the Earth, in like manner, retains her physical attributes,
and does not become the nourishing mother of all things.<a name="FNanchor_1271" id="FNanchor_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a></p>

<p>With a partial exception in the case of Ushas<a name="FNanchor_1272" id="FNanchor_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> (Dawn) the
early Hindu pantheon contains no great female figure; there are
female counterparts of male deities, but no such transcendent
personages as Isis, Athene, and Demeter. Whether this fact is to
be explained from early Hindu views of the social position of
women, or from some other idea, is uncertain. In certain modern
religious cults, however, the worship of the female principle
(&Ccedil;akti) is popular and influential. It is probable that in early
times every tribe or district had its female divine representative
of fertility, an embryonic mother-goddess. If the Aryan Hindus
had such a figure, she failed to grow into a great divinity. But
the worship of such deities came into Aryan India at a relatively
recent date, apparently from non-Aryan sources, and has been
incorporated in Hindu systems. Various forms of &Ccedil;akti have
been brought into relation with various gods, the most important
being those that have become attached to the worship of &Ccedil;iva.<a name="FNanchor_1273" id="FNanchor_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a>
To him is assigned as wife the frightful figure called Durga or
Kali (and known by other names), a blood-loving monster with
an unspeakably licentious cult. Other &Ccedil;akti deities are more
humane, and there is reason to suppose that the ground of the
devotion shown to Kali, especially by women, is in many cases
simply reverence for the female principle in life, or more particularly
for motherhood.<a name="FNanchor_1274" id="FNanchor_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_735" id="p_735">735</a></b>. The original character of the Hindu lord of the Otherworld,
Yama, is obscured by the variety of the descriptions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>him in the documents. In the Rig-Veda he appears both as god
and (as it seems) as man. He is the son of the solar deity
Vivashant (Vivashat); he is named in enumerations of gods, and
Agni is his friend and his priest; he receives worship, and is besought
to come to the sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1275" id="FNanchor_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a> On the other hand, he is never
called "god," but only "king";<a name="FNanchor_1276" id="FNanchor_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> he is spoken of as the "only
mortal," and is said to have chosen death; he is associated in
heaven with the "fathers."<a name="FNanchor_1277" id="FNanchor_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> The modern interpretations of his
origin have followed these two sets of data. By some writers he
has been identified with the sun (particularly the setting sun), and
with the moon.<a name="FNanchor_1278" id="FNanchor_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> But these identifications are set aside for the
Veda by the fact that in lists of gods he is distinguished from sun
and moon.<a name="FNanchor_1279" id="FNanchor_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> By others he is regarded as the mythical first man,
the first ancestor, with residence in the sky, deified as original
ancestors sometimes were, and, as the first to die and enter the
world beyond, made the king of that world.</p>

<p>Though Yama is not the sun in the Veda, it is possible that he
was so regarded in the period preceding the Vedic theological
construction, and in support of this view it may be said that the
sun setting, descending into the depths, is a natural symbol of the
close of man's life,<a name="FNanchor_1280" id="FNanchor_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> and rising, represents the man's life in the beyond&mdash;thus
the sun would be identified with man, and not unnaturally
with the first man, the first to die. In support of the
other view may be cited the great r&ocirc;le ascribed by many peoples
to the first man: in savage lore he is often the creator or arranger
of the world,<a name="FNanchor_1281" id="FNanchor_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> and he is sometimes, like Yama, the son of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_1282" id="FNanchor_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>Such an one, entering the other world, might become its lord, and
in process of time be divinized and made the son of the creator
sun.<a name="FNanchor_1283" id="FNanchor_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> The Hindu figure is often compared to the Avestan first
man, Yima; but Yima, so far as appears, was never divinized,
and is not religiously of great importance. Nor do the late Jewish
legends and theosophical speculations bear on the point under
consideration: in Paradise, it is said, Adam was waited on by
angels, the angels were commanded by God to pay him homage
(so also in the Koran), and he is described as being the light of
the world; and Philo and others conceived of a first or heavenly
man (Adam Kadmon), free from ordinary human weakness, and
identical with the Logos or the Messiah&mdash;therefore a judge in
the largest sense of the word.<a name="FNanchor_1284" id="FNanchor_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> But, while these conceptions testify
to the strong appeal made to the imagination by the figure of the
mythical first man, they throw little light on the original form of
Yama&mdash;the early constructions do not include the judge of the
other world, and the later ones are too late to explain so early a
figure as the Vedic king of that world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_736" id="p_736">736</a></b>. In the Rig-Veda Yama is specifically the overlord of the
blessed dead&mdash;the pious who were thought worthy to dwell in
heaven with the gods and to share to some extent their divinity;
with the wicked he seems to have nothing to do. The general history
of the conception of the future life suggests that in the earliest
Indo-Iranian period there was a hades to which all the dead
went.<a name="FNanchor_1285" id="FNanchor_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> If there was a divine head of this hades (originally an
underground deity, like Osiris, Allatu, and Ploutos) he would
accompany the pious fathers when, in the later Hindu theologic
construction, they were transported to heaven; and if the first
ancestor occupied a distinguished place among the dead,<a name="FNanchor_1286" id="FNanchor_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> he
might be fused with the divine head into a sort of unity, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>result might be such a complex figure as Yama appears to be.
However this may be, the Vedic Yama underwent a development
in accordance with the changes in the religious ideas of the people,
becoming at last an ethical judge of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_1287" id="FNanchor_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_737" id="p_737">737</a></b>. <i>Persia.</i> The Mazdean theistic system presents special difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_1288" id="FNanchor_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a>
The nature of its divine world is remarkable, almost
unique, and the literature that has come down to us was edited at
a comparatively late period, probably not before the middle of the
third century of our era, so that it is not always easy to distinguish
the earlier and the later elements of thought. It is generally regarded
as certain that the two branches of the Aryan race, the
Indian and the Persian, once dwelt together and formed one community,
having the same general religious system: the material of
spirits is substantially the same in the two and they have certain
important names in common&mdash;to the Indian Asura, Soma, Mitra,
the Persian Ahura, Haoma, Mithra correspond in form exactly.
But in the way in which this material was modified and organized
the two communities differ widely.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_738" id="p_738">738</a></b>. The peculiarity of the Persian system is that it practically
disregards all the old gods except Mithra and Anahita, substituting
for them beings designated by names of qualities, and organizes
all extrahuman Powers in two classes&mdash;one under the Good Spirit
(Spenta Mainyu), the other under the Bad Spirit (Angro Mainyu).
The former is attended by six great beings, Immortal Spirits
(Amesha-spentas): Good Mind, Best Order or Law, Holy Harmony
or Wisdom, Piety, Well-being, Immortality.<a name="FNanchor_1289" id="FNanchor_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a> In the Gathas,
which are commonly held to be the most ancient Zoroastrian documents,
these attendants of the supreme god are often nothing
but qualities, but on the other hand are often personified and worshiped.
The rival of the Good Spirit is surrounded similarly by
lying spirits (<i>drujas</i>), among whom one, Aeshma, holds a prominent
place. The two divine chiefs stand side by side in the earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>literature almost as coequal powers; but it is explained that the
wicked one is to be destroyed with all his followers.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_739" id="p_739">739</a></b>. In some of the early hymns (Ya&ccedil;nas) Mithra is closely
attached to Ahura Mazda&mdash;the two are called "the lofty and
imperishable ones." The goddess Anahita, first mentioned in an
inscription of Artaxerxes II, and described only in the late Fifth
Yasht, appears to have been originally a deity of water. It was,
doubtless, her popularity that led to her official recognition by
Artaxerxes; possibly her formal recognition by the Mazdean leaders
was a slow process, since she does not appear in the older
Avesta. In the Yasht she receives worship (being in the form of
a beautiful young woman) as the dispenser of all blessings that
come from pure water; she is said to have been created by Ahura
Mazda, and is wholly subordinated to him. Besides these two a
great number of lesser gods are mentioned; the latter, apparently
the old local gods and spirits here subordinated to the supreme
god, are unimportant in the official cult. The souls of the departed
also become objects of worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_740" id="p_740">740</a></b>. It thus appears that Zoroastrianism was a reform of the
old polytheism. The movement closely resembles the struggle of
the Hebrew prophets against the worship of the Canaanite Baals
and other foreign gods. In both cases there is evidence going to
show that popular cults continued after the leaders of the reform
had thrown off the offensive elements of the old system: the
Hebrew people continued to worship foreign gods long after the
great prophets had pronounced against them; and the official
recognition of Ahura Mazda in the Ach&aelig;menian inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_1290" id="FNanchor_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a> by
no means proves that lower forms of worship were not practiced
in Persia by the people.<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_741" id="p_741">741</a></b>. If we ask for the grounds of this recoil from the old gods,
we must doubtless hold that ethical feeling was a powerful motive
in the reform, though economic and other considerations were,
doubtless, not without influence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p><p>Since Ahura Mazda is ethically good and his worship ethically
pure, there is clearly in its origin hostility to low modes of worship
and to materialistic ideas. Possibly also we have here a struggle
of a clan for the recognition of its own god, as among the Israelites
the Yahweh party represented exclusive devotion to the old
national god. If there was such a clan or party in Persia, it is
obvious that it produced men of high intelligence and great moral
and organizing power, and all that we know of the religious history
leads us to suppose that the establishment of the supremacy of
Ahura Mazda was the result of a long development.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_742" id="p_742">742</a></b>. As to the provenance of the Mazdean supreme lord, not a
few scholars of the present day hold that he was identical with the
Indian Varuna. It is in favor of this identification that the qualities
of the two deities are the same, and there is also the noteworthy
fact that Ahura Mazda is coupled with Mithra as Varuna
is coupled with Mitra; according to this view the Mazdean deity
was originally the god of the sky, by whose side naturally stands
the sun. In a case like this, involving a general agreement between
two systems of thought, there are two possible explanations of the
relation between them: it may be supposed that one borrowed
from the other (in the present case the borrowing would be on
the part of the Persians); or the explanation may be that the two
communities developed original material along the same general
lines, though with local differences. In the absence of historical
data it is perhaps impossible to say which of these explanations is
to be preferred. There is, however, no little difficulty in the supposition
that one community has actually borrowed its religious
system from a neighbor; the general probability is that each followed
its own line.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_743" id="p_743">743</a></b>. Nor is it probable that the rejection of the old divine names
by the Persians was the result of hostility toward their Indian
neighbors. It is doubtless a curious fact that the Indian name for
'evil spirit,' <i>asura</i>, is in Persian the name of a good spirit, Ahura,
while the Indian <i>diva</i>, the general term for a god, is in Persian
the designation of a wicked spirit, <i>daeva</i>. The Persian employment
of <i>daeva</i> for 'evil spirit' may be explained as a protest not against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Indian gods, but against the deities of their own land; so the
Hebrew prophets or their editors apply opprobrious names, "no-god"
and other terms, to deities regarded by them as inadequate.
The abstractions of the Mazdean system have been referred to
above. They seem to have been resorted to from a feeling of profound
disgust at the worship of some class of people. Unfortunately
we have not the historical data that might make the situation clear.
In the Gathas the people of Ahura Mazda are suffering from the
incursions of predatory tribes, and the greater part of the appeals
to the deity are for protection for the herds against their enemies.
We thus have a suggestion of a struggle, political and religious,
between the more civilized Aryans and the savage Tataric tribes
around them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_744" id="p_744">744</a></b>. In the later period of Mazdeanism the old titles of supreme
deity were succeeded (though not displaced) by the terms "Boundless
Time" and "Boundless Space," the latter doubtless suggested
by the vault of heaven. These generalizations, however, had little
influence on the development of the theological side of the religion,
which has continued to regard Ahura Mazda and Angro Mainyu
as the two heads of the world and the determiners of human life.
The rituals of the Mazdean and Hindu faiths were influenced by the
ethical developments of the two, becoming simpler and more humane
with the advance toward elevated conceptions of God and man.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_745" id="p_745">745</a></b>. In view of such facts as are known it may be surmised that
the Mazdean system originated with an Aryan agricultural tribe or
body of tribes dwelling near the Caspian Sea, in contact with hostile
nomads. These Aryans, we may assume, had the ordinary early
apparatus of spirits and nature deities (gods of the sun, water,
etc.), but, at the same time, a disposition to concentrate worship
on a single god (probably a sky-god), who became the chief tribal
deity and was naturally regarded as the source of all things good,
the Good Spirit; the phenomena of life led them (as it led some
other early peoples) to conceive of a rival spirit, the author of things
hostile to life. With economic conditions and intellectual characteristics
very different from those of their Hindu brethren, they developed
no capacity for organizing an elaborate pantheon&mdash;they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
were practically monolatrous, were content with an all-sufficient
Good Spirit (the Bad Spirit being tolerated as an intellectual necessity),
gradually subordinated to him such gods as the popular feeling
retained, and relegated to the sphere of evil the host of inferior
hurtful spirits or gods (<i>daevas</i>) whose existence they could not
deny.<a name="FNanchor_1292" id="FNanchor_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> The religious leaders, representing and enforcing the tribal
tendency of thought, in the course of time gave more and more
definite shape to the cult; perhaps Zoroaster was a pre&euml;minent
agent in this movement. Ethical purification, as a matter of course,
went hand in hand with cultic organization. The old gods or spirits,
associates of the supreme god, became embodiments of moral conceptions,
and a ritual of physical and moral purity was worked out.
Such may have been the general history of the official system; data
for a detailed chronological history are lacking.<a name="FNanchor_1293" id="FNanchor_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_746" id="p_746">746</a></b>. <i>China.</i> Chinese religion is characterized by a remarkable
restraint in ecclesiastical development: simple religious customs, no
native priestly order, few gods, almost no myths. The basis of the
popular religion is the usual material, comprising ancestors, spirits
(including tutelary spirits), a few departmental gods (of war, of the
kitchen, etc.), some of which are said to be deified men. The
system is thus nearly the same as that of the central Asiatic
Mongolians.<a name="FNanchor_1294" id="FNanchor_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_747" id="p_747">747</a></b>. The reflective movement (which must have begun long
before the sixth century B.C., the period of Confucius and Lao-tsze)
is marked by the attempt to perfect the social organization, regard
being paid mainly to visible, practical relations. Stress is laid on the
principle of order in family and state, which is held to reflect the
order of the universe;<a name="FNanchor_1295" id="FNanchor_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> speculation is avoided, there is a minimum
of religion. In the more developed religious system the two prominent
features are, first, the dominant conception of the unity of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>the family and of the state led to the emphasizing of the worship of
ancestors&mdash;a cult which, going back to a very early time, has been
interwoven in China with the individual and communal life in a
thoroughgoing way, with a constant infusion of moral ideas; and
in the next place, the order of society and of the external world is
represented by Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1296" id="FNanchor_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_748" id="p_748">748</a></b>. Originally, doubtless, Heaven was the physical sky (as
among the Hindus and Persians and many other peoples), but at
an early period came to be practically the supreme god. A sort of
monotheistic cult has thus been established as the official religion.
The emperor is the Son of Heaven and the High Priest of the
nation, and in the great annual sacrifices performed by him the
host of minor powers is practically ignored and worship is addressed
to the controlling powers of the world. This official worship does
not set aside the cult of the various spirits, whose existence is recognized
by the minor officials as well as by the people. The cult
of local spirits has grown to extraordinary dimensions. They fill
the land, controlling the conditions of life and demanding constant
regard; and the experts, who are supposed to know the laws governing
the action of the spirits (for example, as to proper burial-places),
wield enormous power, and make enormous charges of
money. These spirits are treated as of subordinate importance
in the official religion. The process by which China has reached
this religious attitude must have extended over millenniums, and,
as is stated above, the intellectual movement in the direction of
simplicity and clearness has been attended by an advance in
ethical purity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_749" id="p_749">749</a></b>. The tendency of Chinese thought is illustrated by the two
systems of philosophy which in the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> formulated
the conception of a universal dominant order:<a name="FNanchor_1297" id="FNanchor_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> Confucius represents
the extreme logical development of natural order in human life
as a product of cosmic order&mdash;he is content absolutely to deal with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>the practical affairs of life and discourages attempts to inquire into
the nature of gods or into the condition of men after death. Lao-tsze,
on the other hand, similarly taking the Way (<i>tao</i>), or Universal
Order, as the informing and controlling power of the world, appears
to have laid the stress on the relation between it and the human
soul&mdash;a conception that has affinities with the Stoic Logos. But
it is Confucianism that has remained the creed of educated China.
Taoism, beginning, apparently, as a spiritual system, did not appeal
to the Chinese feeling, and speedily degenerated into a system
of magical jugglery. Thus the Chinese, with the feeblest religious
sense to be found in any great nation, have nevertheless reached
the grandiose conception of the all-embracing and all-controlling
supreme Heaven. In their case the governing consideration has
been the moral organization of social life, and Nature has swallowed
up all great partial deities.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_750" id="p_750">750</a></b>. <i>Japan.</i> Japan has produced no great god;<a name="FNanchor_1298" id="FNanchor_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> out of the mass
of nature gods reported in the Kojiki not one becomes pre&euml;minent.
There is recognition of Heaven and Earth as the beginning of
things, and of the sun as a deity, but neither the sky-god nor the
sun-goddess becomes a truly high god. Japanese theistic development
appears to have been crippled at an early period by the
intrusion of Chinese influences; the very name of the national
religion, Shinto, 'the Way of the Gods,' is Chinese. The emperor
was deified, and ancestor-worship became the principal popular
cult;<a name="FNanchor_1299" id="FNanchor_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> but Confucianism and Buddhism overlaid the native worship
at an early period. The later forms of Shinto have moved rather
toward the rejection of the old deities than toward the creation of
a great national god.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_751" id="p_751">751</a></b>. <i>Semitic peoples.</i> Among the various Semitic peoples there
is so marked a unity of thought that, as Robertson Smith has
pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_1300" id="FNanchor_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> we may speak of the Semitic religion, though there are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>noteworthy local differences. Generally we find among these communities,
as elsewhere, a large number of local deities, scarcely
distinguishable in their functions one from another.<a name="FNanchor_1301" id="FNanchor_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> A noteworthy
illustration of the long continuance of these local cults is given in
the attempt of the last king of Babylon, Nabonidus, to centralize
the worship by bringing the statues of the local deities to Babylon;
the result was a general popular protest. Similarly an attempt
was made by King Josiah in the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> to centralize
all Israelite worship in Jerusalem, but the history of the succeeding
generations shows that the attempt was not successful. The local
gods represent the clannic and tribal organization, to which the
Semites appear to have clung with peculiar fondness.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_752" id="p_752">752</a></b>. Semitic religion shows an orderly advance through the
medium of tribal and national feeling in conjunction with the
regular moral and intellectual growth of the community. First one
god and then another comes to the front as this or that city attains
leadership, but these chief gods are substantially identical with one
another in functions. The genealogical relations introduced by the
priestly theologians throw no light on the original characters of the
deities and are often ignored in the inscriptions. A natural division
into gods of the sky and gods of the earth may be recognized, but
in the high gods this distinction practically disappears.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_753" id="p_753">753</a></b>. Turning first to the Tigris-Euphrates region, we find certain
nature gods that attained more or less definite universal character.<a name="FNanchor_1302" id="FNanchor_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a>
The physical sky becomes the god Anu, who, though certainly
a great god, was never so prominent as certain other deities, and
in Assyria yielded gradually to Ashur. Why the Semites, in marked
contrast with the Indo-Europeans and the Chinese, have shown a
relatively feeble recognition of the physical heaven we are not able
to say; possibly the tribal feeling referred to above may have led
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>to a centering of devotion on those deities that lay nearer to everyday
life, or in the case of Babylonia it may be that the city with
which Anu was particularly connected lost its early importance, and
its deity in consequence yielded to others.<a name="FNanchor_1303" id="FNanchor_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> The sun is a more definite
and more practically important object than the expanse of the
sky, and the Semitic sun-god, Shamash, plays a great r&ocirc;le from the
earliest to the latest times. The great king Hammurabi (commonly
placed near the year 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), in his noteworthy civil code, takes
Shamash as his patron, as the inspirer of wisdom and the controller
of human right; and from this time onward this deity is
invoked by the kings in their inscriptions. The worship of the
sun was established in Canaan at an early time (as the name of
the town Bethshemesh, 'house of Shemesh,' shows), and under
Assyrian influence was adopted by a large number of Israelites in
the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; the prophet Ezekiel represents prominent
Israelites as standing in the court of the temple, turning their backs
on the sacred house and worshiping the sun;<a name="FNanchor_1304" id="FNanchor_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a> but as to the nature
of the sun-god and his worship in these cases we have no information.
Other nature deities that rose to eminence are the moon-god,
Sin, and the storm-god, Ramman.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_754" id="p_754">754</a></b>. The other deities of the Babylonian and Assyrian pantheons
seem not to be connected by their names with natural
phenomena. They are attached to particular cities or districts,
and each district or city, as it becomes a great religious center,
raises its favorite god to a position of pre&euml;minence. Generally
the choice of a special deity by a particular city lies back of historical
documents, and the reason for such choice therefore cannot be
definitely fixed. The attributes and functions of the resulting great
gods, as has already been remarked, are substantially everywhere
the same, and where one function becomes prominent, it is often possible
to explain its prominence from the political or other conditions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_755" id="p_755">755</a></b>. Moreover, as in all theological constructions that follow
great political unifications, it was natural to extend the domain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>of a principal god to whatever department of life or of nature
appealed especially to the theologian. When we find certain gods
invested with solar functions it does not follow that they were
originally sun-gods&mdash;such functions may be a necessary result
of their pre&euml;minence. Out of the great mass of Babylonian and
Assyrian deities we may select a few whose cults illustrate the
method of development of the religious conceptions. As non-Semitic
(Sumerian) religious and other ideas and words appear to
have been adopted by the Semitic Babylonians, it is not always
easy to distinguish between Semitic and non-Semitic conceptions
in the cults as known to us.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_756" id="p_756">756</a></b>. <i>Babylonia.</i> The god Ea appears to have been originally
the local deity of Eridu, a city which in early times stood on the
Persian Gulf. This proximity to the sea may account for the fact
that Ea was generally associated with water (in Babylonia, as elsewhere,
there were many deities of waters). It is not certain that
this was his original r&ocirc;le, but it was, in any case, assigned him in
the course of the theistic construction. It is not improbable that
in the original form of the Babylonian epic it was Ea who sent
the flood and saved one man&mdash;a natural representation for the
god of Eridu; in later recensions of the poem it is first Bel and
then Marduk who assumes the principal r&ocirc;le. As Eridu was
probably a prominent political center, Ea, as its chief god, naturally
became the creator, the bestower of wisdom, the author of
the arts of life, in general a universal god. As the political center
shifted, the popular interest changed and Ea yielded more or less
to other gods, continuing, however, throughout the whole Babylonian
and Assyrian period to receive high consideration.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_757" id="p_757">757</a></b>. Enlil, the god of Nippur, had a similar career; originally
local, he became supreme. A peculiar feature of his history is the
fact that the title Bel, 'lord' (which is the Semitic equivalent of
the non-Semitic Enlil), clung to him in a peculiar way and practically
ousted the original name. This title was assigned to various
gods (so in Canaan the title Baal), and its special appropriation by
the god of Nippur must be referred to the preponderant importance
of that city in the period before the rise of Babylon. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Babylonian system he is lord of the lower world, that is, apparently,
the divine king of the earth; his original domain, the district
of Nippur, was extended to embrace the whole world&mdash;a
sort of extension that was common in all ancient religions. His
importance is evident from the fact that he was a member of the
early triad, Anu, Bel, Ea, names that have been supposed to represent
three divisions of the world into heaven, earth, and ocean.
It seems probable, however, that this triadic grouping was the
work of relatively late constructionists; it is more likely that the
original prominence of these three deities was due to the fact that
they represented the more important political communities.<a name="FNanchor_1305" id="FNanchor_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_758" id="p_758">758</a></b>. A particularly good illustration of the dependence of a
god's position on the political position of his region is furnished
by the god Marduk, a name the meaning of which is uncertain.
He is first clearly mentioned in the inscriptions of Hammurabi
(ca. 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), but mentioned in such a way that his cult must
go back to a much earlier time. From the devotion paid him by
Hammurabi, and much later by Nebuchadrezzar II (sixth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), it is generally assumed that he was the local god of Babylon.
He rose with the fortunes of this city, finally becoming supreme:
he was regarded as creator, and invested with all the highest functions;
in the later astronomical constructions he is represented as
the arranger of the zodiacal system and all that was connected
with it, but, as is pointed out above, this is no ground for regarding
him as having been originally a sun-god. A glimpse into the
method of theological reconstruction is afforded by the representation
in the cosmogonic epic where he is invested with supreme
power by the older gods&mdash;this investiture is with probability
regarded by Assyriologists as representing the leadership attained
by the city of Babylon (ca. 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), whose religious hegemony
lasted throughout the existence of the Babylonian state.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_759" id="p_759">759</a></b>. <i>Assyria.</i> The Assyrian pantheon is in general identical
with that of Babylon, but has certain features which are due to
the peculiar character of the Assyrian civilization. The god Ashur,
originally the local god of the city or district of Ashur, and then
the chief god of Assyria, was naturally a war-god&mdash;Assyria was
essentially a military nation, differing in this regard from Babylonia.
He is, however, more than a mere god of war&mdash;he has all high
attributes, and came to represent in Assyria that approach to
monotheism which in Babylon was embodied in the later cult
of Marduk.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_760" id="p_760">760</a></b>. Babylonian and Assyrian <i>female deities</i> are of two classes:
those who are merely consorts of the male deities, and those who
represent fertility. The first class we may pass over&mdash;the goddesses
of this class are vague in character and functions and play
no important part in the religious system; they appear to be artificial
creations of the systematizers. The deities of the second
class, however, are important. From a very early time the fertility
of nature has been referred appropriately to female Powers,
and in the Semitic pantheon a large number of such divinities
occur. A deity of this sort naturally becomes a mother-goddess,
with all the attributes that pertain to this character; in some cases
a mother-goddess becomes supreme.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_761" id="p_761">761</a></b>. A very early female divinity is Bau, worshiped particularly
at the city Lagash and by King Gudea. Her function as
patron of productiveness is probably indicated in the spring festival
held in her honor on New Year's Day, in which she is worshiped
as the giver of the fruits of the earth. There are several
local female deities that seem to be substantially identical in character
with Bau. Innanna (or Ninni) in Uruk (Erech) was the
mistress of the world and of war, and Nana is hardly to be distinguished
from her.<a name="FNanchor_1306" id="FNanchor_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> In Agade Anunit has a similar r&ocirc;le; in
Lagash Nina was the determiner of fate, and the mother of the
goddesses.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_762" id="p_762">762</a></b>. These names appear to be titles signifying 'mistress,'
'lady,' and this is probably the meaning of the name of the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>goddess who finally ousted or absorbed her sisters, Ishtar.<a name="FNanchor_1307" id="FNanchor_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> In the
earliest form in which Ishtar appears, in the old poetry, she is the
deity of fertility; when she goes down to the Underworld all productiveness
of plants and men ceases; and her primitive character
at this time appears in the account of her marriages with animals,
in which there is to be recognized the trace of the old zo&ouml;latrous
period; but as patron of fertility she becomes in time a great goddess
and takes on universal attributes&mdash;she is the mother of gods
and men, universal protector and guide. Where war was the chief
pursuit she became a goddess of war; in this character she appears
in Babylonia as early as the time of Hammurabi, and later in
Assyria. In the genealogical constructions she was brought into
connection, as daughter, wife, or other relation, with any god that
the particular conditions suggested. As the Assyrians grew morally
she was endowed with all the highest virtues (so in the Penitential
Psalms), and occupied so pre&euml;minent a position that under
favorable circumstances she might perhaps have become the only
god of the land.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_763" id="p_763">763</a></b>. If her name signified originally 'lord' or 'lady,' the occurrence
of several Ishtars in Assyria (particularly Ishtar of Nineveh
and Ishtar of Arbela) is easily understood; so in Canaan, as
we learn from the Old Testament, there was a great number of
local Ashtarts.<a name="FNanchor_1308" id="FNanchor_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> We can thus also explain the male deities Ashtar
in Moab and Athtar in South Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_1309" id="FNanchor_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> None of these, however,
attained the eminence of the Babylonian and Assyrian Ishtar; her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>supremacy in Mesopotamia was due doubtless in part to the political
importance of the cities that adopted her. She had her rivals,
as we have seen, in Marduk and Ashur and others; and that she
was able to maintain herself is to be ascribed in some measure to
the importance attached by her worshipers to the fertilizing power
of nature.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_764" id="p_764">764</a></b>. The other Semitic peoples, with the exception of the
Hebrews, offer little material for tracing the development of the
great gods. For the Aramean region the records are sparse; Aramean
deities appear to be of the same character as the Canaanite.<a name="FNanchor_1310" id="FNanchor_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a>
In Canaan (including Ph&oelig;nicia) out of the vast number of local
divinities, the Baals and Ashtarts, few attained to eminence, and it
is doubtful whether any one of them deserves the title "great."<a name="FNanchor_1311" id="FNanchor_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a>
The divine patrons of cities were locally powerful; such were the
Baal of Tyre, called Melkart ('the king of the city'), the Ashtart
of Sidon, and Tanit of Carthage;<a href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> these owed their reputation
to their official positions, and there is no other record of their development.
The same thing is true of the Moabite Kemosh, the
Ammonite Malkom (Milkom), and the Philistine Dagan (Dagon)
and Baalzebub. None of these became ethically great or approached
universality. The Ph&oelig;nician Eshmun was known to the Greeks,
and was identified by them with their Asklepios (&AElig;sculapius),
probably because among the various functions attaching to him
as local deity healing was prominent; but of his theologic history
little is known.<a name="FNanchor_1312" id="FNanchor_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a> Several North Arabian deities, especially Dusares
(Dhu ash-Shara) and the goddesses Al-L&acirc;t and Al-Uzza, were
widely worshiped, their cults extending over the whole Nabatean
region; but the communities to which they belonged never
produced a great civilization or attained great political significance,
and these deities always retained traces of their local
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>nature.<a name="FNanchor_1313" id="FNanchor_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> The same remark is to be made of the South Arabian
gods known to us; they were locally important, but we have
little information concerning their characters.<a name="FNanchor_1314" id="FNanchor_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_765" id="p_765">765</a></b>. The clearest example of the orderly advance of a deity to
pre&euml;minence is afforded by the Hebrew Yahweh (Jehovah). Originally,
it would seem, a local deity, the god of certain tribes on the
northern boundary of Arabia,<a name="FNanchor_1315" id="FNanchor_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> he was adopted by the Hebrews
under conditions which are not quite clear, and was developed by
them in accordance with their peculiar genius. At first morally and
intellectually crude, he became as early as the eighth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
ethically high and practically omnipotent.<a name="FNanchor_1316" id="FNanchor_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a> For many centuries he
was regarded merely as the most powerful of the gods, superior
to the deities of other nations, and it was only after the beginning
of our era that the Hebrew thought discarded all other
gods and made "Yahweh" synonymous with "God." In each
period of their history the conception that the Hebrews had of
him was in accord with the economic and intellectual features of
the time.<a name="FNanchor_1317" id="FNanchor_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_766" id="p_766">766</a></b>. A word may be added respecting the Semitic titles Ilu, or
El, and Elohim, which have been supposed by some recent writers
to prove the existence of an early monotheism, particularly in
Southern Arabia. The terms mean simply 'god,' and were applied
by early Semitic communities to any deity, particularly to the local
god. In the Arabia of Mohammed's time a tribe would call
its deity simply "the god," a sufficient designation of him for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>place;<a name="FNanchor_1318" id="FNanchor_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a> this designation, in Arabic <i>al-ilahu</i>, came to be pronounced
"Allah," and this familar term, as is remarked above, was adopted
by Mohammed and expanded (probably under the influence of
some advanced Arabian circle of thinkers of his time) into the conception
of the one only god, which he and others had derived from
Christians and Jews. In certain parts of the Old Testament also
"Elohim" stands for the national god, conceived of as all-sufficient.
But these are late conceptions. There is no proof that in South
Arabia or in Babylonia the term Ilu meant anything else than the
local deity, though such a deity would naturally receive all the attributes
that his worshipers demanded in their religious constructions.
Most of the appellations of Semitic deities are epithets, and while
this mode of conceiving of the gods militated against the development
of them into distinct personalities and the construction of a
pantheon, it was favorable, on the other hand, to isolation and to the
tendency to elevate any favorite deity to a position of pre&euml;minence.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_767" id="p_767">767</a></b>. <i>Greece.</i> The Greeks, with their rich imagination and artistic
feeling, filled the world with divine figures, well-defined types of
Greek character, ideals of Greek thought. Greece alone has constructed
a true pantheon, a community of gods all individualized,
but all compacted into a family or a body of government. The
question of their historical development involves great difficulties,
partly because the wide diffusion of their cults in Hellas occasioned
many local expansions of the original conceptions in the various
regions, partly because most of the deities appear fully or almost
fully formed in the earliest literary monuments, so that we are
dependent on cultic procedures and passing allusions for a knowledge
of their preliterary character. Without, then, attempting an
investigation of the obscure prehistoric theogonic period, the general
lines of growth of some of the principal divine personages
may be followed (as far as the data permit) as examples of the way
in which the great gods were gradually created.<a name="FNanchor_1319" id="FNanchor_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span><b><a name="p_768" id="p_768">768</a></b>. Zeus, originally doubtless a sky-god (not the sun), represents
an old Indo-European divine conception, found substantially
also among all the great peoples of antiquity, as well as in many
half-civilized tribes. But nowhere has he attained so eminent a
position as in Greece. The Hindu Dyaus (the 'shining one')<a name="FNanchor_1320" id="FNanchor_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> is
not prominent in the Vedic mythology or in later times, and the
Mazdean Ahura Mazda, if he was originally the sky, had dropped
his physical characteristics and become only a spirit; the Latin
Jupiter approaches Zeus most nearly in name and character. A
sky-god is naturally conceived of as universal ruler,<a name="FNanchor_1321" id="FNanchor_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> but in any
particular region he assumes the characteristics of the ruling human
personages of the place and time. Zeus appears first as a barbarian
chieftain with the ordinary qualities of such persons. Stories that
have come down about him reflect a period of what now seems
immorality, though it was the recognized morality of the time; he
is deceitful and changeable and completely unregardful of any
definite marriage laws. His cult in some places (for example, in
Arcadia) had savage features. Whether he had originally in the
Hellenic world a special home, and if so what it was, cannot now
be determined.<a name="FNanchor_1322" id="FNanchor_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_769" id="p_769">769</a></b>. In the historical period he appears as a chief god in many
places in Greece, gradually absorbs the functions of other gods,
and receives numerous titles derived from places and functions. He
is the father of gods and men, but not the sole creator of the world.
His gradual rise in moral character may be traced in the literature.
In Homer he is a universalized Agamemnon, with very much the intellectual
and moral qualities of Agamemnon; a process of growth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>in the conception of him in the Homeric poems is indicated by
the incongruities in his portraiture&mdash;at one time he is a creature
of impulse and passion, at another time a dignified and thoughtful
ruler. In Pindar and the tragedians of the fifth century he has become
the representative of justice and order in the world, and in later
writers he comes to be more specifically the embodiment of everything
that is good in the universe. He represents the Greek conception
of civic authority, and thus the nearest approach to monotheism
discoverable in the Greek mythological system; and as embodying
the finer side of religious feeling he both punishes and forgives sin.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_770" id="p_770">770</a></b>. Next in importance to Zeus as representative of Greek
religious thought stands Apollo. The meaning of the name and the
original seat of the god are obscure; he appears to have been a
Pan-Hellenic deity; he was definitely shaped by the whole mass of
Hellenic thought. Originally, perhaps, the local deity of some
hunting and pastoral region, and possessing the quasi-universal
attributes of such deities, the wide diffusion of his cult (through
conditions not known to us) brought him into relation with many
sides of life. While he shares this many-sidedness with several
other gods, the Greek genius of theographic organization assigned
him special headship in certain distinctively Hellenic conceptions.
Zeus embodied the theocratic idea, and Apollo the ideas of Pan-Hellenic
civic unity, artistic feeling, and the more intimate ethical
and religious experience. He became the patron of the Amphictyonic
assembly and of literature and art, and, especially in connection
with the Delphic oracle, the fosterer of ethical conceptions of ritual
and of sin. How it came to pass that these particular departments
were assigned him it is not possible to say. Such specialization was
natural to the Greeks, but the determining conditions in particular
cases have not been recorded, and can only be surmised. His
growth kept pace with that of the Hellenic people&mdash;in the Iliad
he is a partisan, and his words and deeds do not always command
our respect, but in the later theological constructions he throws
off his crudeness. His connection with the sun was a natural consequence
of his rise to eminence; he is not a sun-god in the earliest
literary remains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="p_771" id="p_771">771</a></b>. Poseidon, second only to Zeus in power, is also of obscure
origin.<a name="FNanchor_1323" id="FNanchor_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> His specific marine character is certain, though as a great
god he had many relations and functions.<a name="FNanchor_1324" id="FNanchor_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> Possibly he was originally
the local deity of some marine region, and by reason of the
importance of his native place, or simply through the intimate
relationship between the Greek communities, and in accordance
with the Greek spirit of organization, came to be generally recognized
as the god of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_1325" id="FNanchor_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a> Though he was widely revered he
remained largely a nature god&mdash;he never attained the majesty and
moral supremacy of Zeus, never, indeed, represented specifically
any refined moral or religious conception. Whether this ethical
and religious meagerness was a consequence of the vagueness of
the relation between the sea and human life, or of some other fact,
is a point that can hardly be determined.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_772" id="p_772">772</a></b>. Hermes, to judge from his history, was the creation of
some pastoral community, an ideal of rustic excellence: fleet of
foot, a leader in popular amusements, skilled in simple music, eminent
in an art much valued in early times&mdash;the art of stealing
cattle. When he was taken into the circle of Greek theological
thought his swiftness recommended him to the position of messenger
of the gods,<a name="FNanchor_1326" id="FNanchor_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> and his function as psychopompos, the guide of
souls to the other world, would then follow naturally; from this
function it cannot, however, be inferred that he was originally a
chthonic deity&mdash;a character that does not accord with the early
portraitures of him. Like other gods he grew morally, but he never
reached ethical distinction. Skill in theft was in early times often
regarded as a virtue,<a name="FNanchor_1327" id="FNanchor_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> and in general he who got the better of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>fellows was esteemed a master of good luck and prosperity; and
a bestower of outward prosperity Hermes came to be.<a name="FNanchor_1328" id="FNanchor_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> His main
quality was cleverness, in contrast with the intellectual power of
Apollo.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_773" id="p_773">773</a></b>. On the other hand, another rustic figure, the Arcadian
herd-god Pan,<a name="FNanchor_1329" id="FNanchor_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a> never developed into a great Hellenic god. His
worship was widely diffused; he appears often in artistic representations,
and Pindar thought him worthy of a hymn (of which,
unfortunately, only fragments survive), but in general he remained
uncouth and half savage, a goatlike figure, the companion of
satyrs, or (as the Homeric hymn depicts him) a merrymaker.
He seems to have been an embodiment of the lower rustic
pleasures, a local god, probably not a divinized goat.<a name="FNanchor_1330" id="FNanchor_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_774" id="p_774">774</a></b>. His name, however, taken to mean 'all,' gave occasion
to fanciful interpretations. He was so called, it was said, because
he gave delight to all the Immortals;<a name="FNanchor_1331" id="FNanchor_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a> or his person and his
musical and other instruments were supposed to represent universal
nature&mdash;his horns the rays of the sun and the horns of
the moon, his spotted fawnskin the stars, his pipe of seven reeds
the harmony of the heavens, his crook the year, which returns on
itself, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_1332" id="FNanchor_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a> The Stoics and the Orphic writers made him
Universal God, the creator of the world.<a name="FNanchor_1333" id="FNanchor_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> In the popular cult,
however, he remained the merry patron of herds. The most satisfactory
explanation of his name is that which derives it from the
stem <i>pa</i>, 'feed'&mdash;he is then "the goatherd."<a name="FNanchor_1334" id="FNanchor_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> The story told
by Plutarch, of a voice heard crying on the coast of Epirus,
"Great Pan is dead," arose from some misapprehension, but no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>precise explanation of its origin has been given.<a name="FNanchor_1335" id="FNanchor_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> Poets like Pindar
and Vergil, disposed to preserve and dignify the old traditions,
treat Pan respectfully and sympathetically, but such constructions
are nonpopular.<a name="FNanchor_1336" id="FNanchor_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_775" id="p_775">775</a></b>. Ares seems to be the creation of a war-loving tribe; in
the Iliad he is a fierce warrior, armed cap-a-pie, delighting in
battle and slaughter. Through the machinations of Hera and
Athene he is overcome by human heroes, the poet's feeling being,
possibly, contempt for the mere savage fighter; in fact, Ares in
the Iliad is, from our point of view, hardly a respectable character&mdash;he
violates his promise, and when wounded cries out like
a hurt child. But as war-god he was widely revered in Greece;
in Thebes especially he was honored as one of the great gods.
Hesiod makes him the son of Zeus and Hera,<a name="FNanchor_1337" id="FNanchor_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> but he never
attains moral or other dignity; in the popular cult he remained,
probably, merely the patron of war. In the later artistic representations
he is the ideal of warlike vigor and grace. In the
Homeric hymn (which may be of Orphic origin) he is transformed
into a lover of peace and a source of all pure and lofty
aspirations&mdash;a violent procedure, induced by the poet's unwillingness
that an Olympian should represent anything but what
was morally good.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_776" id="p_776">776</a></b>. The process of development of a god's character is illustrated
with special clearness by the history of Dionysus. It is
generally agreed that he was of foreign origin, an importation
from Thrace. The features of his earliest cult known to us are
marked by bald savagery. His worshipers indulged in wild
orgies, probably excited by intoxicating drinks, tore to pieces a
goat (as in Thrace) or a bull (as in Crete) and ate the flesh raw;<a name="FNanchor_1338" id="FNanchor_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a>
and the evidence goes to show that they practiced human sacrifice.
All these procedures have parallels in known savage cults.
Omophagic orgies are described by Nilus (among the Saracens),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>and such customs are reported as existing or having existed in
the Fiji Islands and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1339" id="FNanchor_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> Among many tribes intoxication
is a common preparation for the work of the shaman; and human
sacrifice has been practiced in all parts of the world. There is
nothing peculiar in the office of soothsayer that accompanied the
Dionysiac cult; mantic persons and procedures have formed a
prominent part of the constitution of the lower peoples everywhere.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_777" id="p_777">777</a></b>. Dionysus, in a word, was originally the local god of a
savage community; the data are not sufficient to fix precisely his
original place and the original conception of him. His mantic
function does not necessarily show that he was a ghost. It is
true that the dead were often consulted (and necromancy long
survived among civilized peoples), but any spirit or god might
take possession of a worshiper and make him the vehicle of
revelation. Nor is the phallus-cult peculiar to Dionysus; this cult
is widely diffused, and its origin is to be referred not specifically
to the recognition of the general generative power of nature, but
to the mystery of human life.<a name="FNanchor_1340" id="FNanchor_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a> In his original home Dionysus
seems to have represented everything that touched the life of his
people. When, at a certain time, he passed into Hellas (carried,
doubtless, by immigrants), he took on the character necessitated
by his new surroundings&mdash;a process of transformation began.
Exact chronological data are lacking, but as in the Iliad<a name="FNanchor_1341" id="FNanchor_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a> he is
the son of Zeus, he must have been adopted by the Greeks very
early. In his new home he became the patron of the vine.<a name="FNanchor_1342" id="FNanchor_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a> In a
vine-growing region any prominent deity may become a wine-god;<a name="FNanchor_1343" id="FNanchor_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a>
but the special connection of Dionysus with wine in Greece suggests
that in his earlier home he was somehow identified with intoxicating
drinks. With vegetation in general also he may have
been connected in Thrace&mdash;such a relation would be natural for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>a clan god&mdash;and in that case his Hellenic r&ocirc;le as god of vegetation
would follow as a matter of course; or, if he advanced from
the vine to the whole of vegetable nature, the development is
intelligible.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_778" id="p_778">778</a></b>. When and on what grounds he was accepted as one of
the Olympians is not clear;<a name="FNanchor_1344" id="FNanchor_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a> perhaps it was on account of the
importance of vine culture, perhaps from the mysterious character
of his cult, the enthusiasm of divine inspiration reflected in the
frenzy of the worshipers, or from these causes combined; his later
name, Bacchus, which seems to refer to cultic orgiastic shouting,
would appear to indicate this element of the cult as a main
source of his popularity. Once established as a great god he
was credited with various functions. The Greek drama arose in
connection with his worship, and at Eleusis the old element of
seizure by the god was transformed by the higher thought of the
time into the conception of ethical union with the deity. Thus the
old savage god came to stand for man's highest aspirations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_779" id="p_779">779</a></b>. As among other peoples, so among the Greeks the government
of the Underworld was gradually organized, and a head
thereof appointed.<a name="FNanchor_1345" id="FNanchor_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> Already in the Iliad and in Hesiod<a name="FNanchor_1346" id="FNanchor_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> the universe
is divided into three parts under the rule of the Kronids
Zeus, Poseidon, and A&iuml;des respectively; the earth, however, and
Olympos, says Poseidon, are the common property of them all&mdash;there
was no complete governmental separation between the
Underworld and the Upperworld. The Greeks, with their joy in
the present, gave comparatively little prominence to the future
(being herein sharply contrasted with the Egyptians).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_780" id="p_780">780</a></b>. The title generally given to the underground chief, Hades
(apparently 'the invisible one'), indicates the vagueness that attached
to this deity.<a name="FNanchor_1347" id="FNanchor_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> In the Iliad he is a dark and dread divinity.
The precise significance of his title Plouton<a name="FNanchor_1348" id="FNanchor_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> is uncertain; but
under this name he is connected in the myths with processes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>vegetation&mdash;it is Plouton who carries off Persephone, leaving the
world in the deadness of winter. The figure of the underground
deity appears to have taken shape from the combination of two
mythological conceptions&mdash;the underground fructifying forces of
nature, and the assemblage of the dead in a nether world or kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_1349" id="FNanchor_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a>
His only moral significance lay in his relation to oaths,
wherein, perhaps, is an approach to the idea of a divine judge
below the earth.<a name="FNanchor_1350" id="FNanchor_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_781" id="p_781">781</a></b>. The <i>female deities</i> of the Greeks are no less elaborately
worked out than the male gods, and, like these, are types of
human character and representatives of human pursuits.<a name="FNanchor_1351" id="FNanchor_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_782" id="p_782">782</a></b>. The great goddess Hera is in Homer attached especially
to Argos, Sparta, and Mycen&aelig;, but at a very early time was Pan-Hellenic.
The meaning of her name and her origin are uncertain.
There is no good ground for regarding her as having been originally
a moon-goddess (Selene was the real moon-goddess). What
is certain is that she had a special relation to women and particularly
to childbirth; but such a function is so generally attributed
to some goddess that we can only suppose that she rose to eminence
through local conditions unknown to us. The most interesting
point about her is that she came to be the representative of
the respectable Greek matron, jealous of her wifely rights, holding
herself aloof from love affairs, a home person, entitled to respect
for the decency of her life, but without great womanly charm.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_783" id="p_783">783</a></b>. By a natural mythological law she was regarded as the
consort of Zeus, and gradually acquired dignity without, however,
ever coming to be a distinct embodiment of any form of intellectual
or moral life. As Zeus embodied the conception of civil and
political headship, so Hera appears to have embodied the idea of
the wife as controller of the purely domestic affairs of the family,
her business being the bringing up of children and the oversight
of servants&mdash;duties that may have seemed at an early period not
to require great moral and intellectual power.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span><b><a name="p_784" id="p_784">784</a></b>. A distincter form is that of Demeter, who, whatever the
meaning of her name,<a name="FNanchor_1352" id="FNanchor_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> certainly represents the fertile earth&mdash;a
figure similar to hundreds of others in the world, and doubtless
existing at various points in Greece under local names; she probably
represents a unification of the different conceptions of the
fertile earth, a process that went on in the natural way in Greek
thought, and was formulated by the poets. Her historical connection
with the great Asian earth-goddess, the Mother-Goddess,
is uncertain. Demeter, however, never became the great earth-mother;
she remained attached to the soil, except that in the
Eleusinian mysteries she (probably as patron of fertility) was
allegorized into a representation of those moral conceptions of
the future that gradually arose in Greece.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_785" id="p_785">785</a></b>. The group of deities that may be called maiden goddesses
is of peculiar interest. A maiden goddess is originally an independent
deity who, for whatever reason, has not been brought by
the myth-makers into marriage relations with a male deity. Generally
such independence is a result of the fact that the goddess is the
representative of fertility. She may, in accordance with early customs
of human society, choose temporary consorts at will (as is the
case with Ishtar); she may be in her sole person (like the Dea
Mater) the productive power of the world; or she may remain a
virgin, occupied only with the care of some department of life (so
Athene and Artemis). Which of these characters she takes depends
on early social conditions and on the nature of the local theistic
organization. In Greece these goddesses assume various shapes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_786" id="p_786">786</a></b>. There is first the primitive divine Power of vegetation,
called simply the Kore, the Maiden, a figure ultimately identical
with Demeter and in the later constructions represented as her
daughter. She is not necessarily to be regarded as a development
out of an original corn-spirit. Her title "maiden" may be compared
with the Semitic title "mistress," mentioned above, and with
the names expressing family relations, "sister," "mother"&mdash;only
this particular designation defines her simply as an unmarried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>female divinity. The "corn-maiden" of modern European folk-lore
may be the cultic degradation of an old deity.<a name="FNanchor_1353" id="FNanchor_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a> The title Kore became
almost a proper name, though the designation was not so
definite as in the cases of Bel and Ishtar.<a name="FNanchor_1354" id="FNanchor_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_787" id="p_787">787</a></b>. As the Kore is the representative of vegetable life, so
Hestia stands in general for the indoor life, the family. She long
retained this local character, but gradually assumed the position of
the great goddess of the home center, the hearth,<a name="FNanchor_1355" id="FNanchor_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> and was connected
with the household fires and festivals. She represents the
more intimate social life of the family in contrast with Hera, who
stands for the government of the household.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_788" id="p_788">788</a></b>. The development of the functions of Artemis is comparatively
clear. The origin of the name is doubtful, but in the earliest
records she is connected with the fertile earth, with vegetable and
also with animal life.<a name="FNanchor_1356" id="FNanchor_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a> This character indicates that she was at one
time a local, all-sufficient deity, though it is hardly possible to determine
her original seat. As a local goddess in the hunting area
she was naturally connected with the chase, and as a female divinity
she was the patroness of marriage and the protector of human
birth. Her original nature as the maiden appears in the representation
of her as a virgin which occurs in Homer.<a name="FNanchor_1357" id="FNanchor_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> There is no
contradiction between this character and her function of presiding
over marriage and birth if we consider her as a local goddess who
from one point of view was regarded as a simple maiden, from
another point of view as the protector of women.<a name="FNanchor_1358" id="FNanchor_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> Thus invested
with the control of these important features of life she naturally
became a general patroness, a guardian. Later she was connected
with Apollo as his sister, exactly by what steps we do not know;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>and in the mythical constructions she was represented as the daughter
of Zeus and Leto.<a name="FNanchor_1359" id="FNanchor_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_789" id="p_789">789</a></b>. The Hellenic goddess Artemis is to be distinguished from
the Ephesian deity to whom the Greeks gave the same name,
though when the Greeks came into close contact with Asia Minor
the two were identified. And in fact, though in historical origin the
two deities are to be kept apart, they doubtless go back to the
same conception. The Ephesian goddess was the Great Mother&mdash;she
stood specifically for the idea of maternity which lies at the
basis of the world; the Greek divinity, beginning as a local protectress,
took on larger functions which gave her general resemblance
to the universal mother.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_790" id="p_790">790</a></b>. The relation between Artemis and Hekate is an illustration
of the process of co&ouml;rdination and harmonization that went on continually
among the Greeks. Hekate does not appear in Homer,
but in Hesiod she has the full form of a great deity&mdash;she exercises
control over heaven, earth, and sea;<a name="FNanchor_1360" id="FNanchor_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> and at a later period
she becomes similarly connected with the Underworld. This variety
of functions can be explained only by the supposition that she also
was a local deity, who, like all local deities, was regarded as universal.<a name="FNanchor_1361" id="FNanchor_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a>
As the meaning of her name is uncertain and her original
region unknown, it can be only surmised that her cult spread gradually
in Greece through the growing unification of the Hellenic
states. Like Artemis she presided over human birth. The functions
of the two goddesses being so nearly the same (they appear to
represent similar conceptions arising at different centers), it was
natural that in the later times they should be identified or closely
associated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span><b><a name="p_791" id="p_791">791</a></b>. Athene is said in a late myth (not in the Iliad) to have been
born from the head of Zeus, a representation that has led many
recent scholars to regard her as the goddess of the thunderstorm,
the lightning that cleaves the clouds, the divine warrior that slays
the dragon. But ingenious and attractive as this interpretation is,
to determine the origin of the goddess it is safer to go to the
earlier forms of her cult. At a very early period she is connected
with ordinary social occupations.<a name="FNanchor_1362" id="FNanchor_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> She is the patroness of the cultivation
of the land; in Athens, where the olive was important, it was
she who bestowed this tree on the city; here she is the maiden,
the genius, the divine patron of vegetation. She presided over the
domestic employments of women, spinning and weaving&mdash;that is,
she is the goddess of household work.<a name="FNanchor_1363" id="FNanchor_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a> As is the case with so
many divine patrons of men's early simple employments, she grew
with the community and became gradually a great goddess, and
necessarily a patroness of cities. In her character of general
patroness she became a goddess of war&mdash;a necessity for all
ancient states. On the other hand, in a community (like Athens,
for example) where intellectual insight was highly esteemed she
would naturally become the representative of cleverness and
wisdom.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_792" id="p_792">792</a></b>. The peculiar nature of the wisdom that is prized by men
depends on time and place. In the earliest periods what Athene
bestows is a high degree of common sense and skill in devising
ways and means, such as Odysseus shows. In later times of larger
cultivation she bestows wisdom in the higher sense, intellectual
breadth. Exactly how it came to pass that the two figures Artemis
and Athene developed on such different lines we are unable to say&mdash;the
beginning of the divergence goes back to times of which we
have no records; but, as gods represent the elements of human life,
it was natural that a gradual differentiation should take place; the
same general conception would be particularized in different ways
in different places, just as divergent forms of the same original word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>acquire different significations in speech.<a name="FNanchor_1364" id="FNanchor_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> As for the later combination
of these deities with heavenly bodies and many other things,
these are to be regarded as the product of later poetical imagination
and the tendency to universalize all great deities.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_793" id="p_793">793</a></b>. Aphrodite exhibits more clearly than any other deity the
process or the direction of the Hellenization of a foreign god. Her
titles Cypris, Paphia, Cytherea, as well as her connection with
Adonis, point, as is generally held, to a Semitic origin<a name="FNanchor_1365" id="FNanchor_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a>; she seems
to have been identical with the great Babylonian, Assyrian, and
Syrian goddess Ishtar (Astarte)<a name="FNanchor_1366" id="FNanchor_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a>. Received into the Greek pantheon
at a very early time (already in the Iliad she is one of the
Olympians), she yet shows the main characteristics of the Semitic
deity<a name="FNanchor_1367" id="FNanchor_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a>&mdash;she is especially the representative of fertility and sexual
passion, and also has relation to war. The lines of development,
however, were different in different communities. In Babylonia and
Assyria Ishtar became a great universal national deity, charged particularly
with the care of all the interests of the state, while in Syria
and Canaan the corresponding figures (Attar, Ashtart) remained
to a great extent local, and were especially prominent in festivals.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_794" id="p_794">794</a></b>. In Greece the conception of Aphrodite was worked out in
a non-Semitic way in two directions. By poets and philosophers
she was made the beneficent producer of all things, shedding her
charm over animate and inanimate nature;<a name="FNanchor_1368" id="FNanchor_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a> and the sentiment of
love, for which she stood, was exalted into a pure affection, the
basis of married life. The baser side of her cult, with its sexual
license (Asiatic of origin), remained along with the higher conception
of her,<a name="FNanchor_1369" id="FNanchor_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> but the latter was the special contribution that the
Greeks made to her development.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span><b><a name="p_795" id="p_795">795</a></b>. The theistic scheme of the old Greek polytheistic period is
the broadest and finest that the ancient polytheism produced. It
recognized a divine element in all sides of human life, from the
lowest to the highest; it marked out the various directions of
human feeling and effort, and in its final outcome it reached the
conception of a unity in the divine government of the world, and
gave expression to man's best aspirations for the present and for
the future. True, it gave way at last to philosophy; but it had
recognized those elements of thought on which philosophy was
based. The Persian and Hebrew systems expressed more definitely
the idea of a divine monocracy, and lent themselves easily to
the formation of a religious society, a church, but they did not
escape the limitations of mere national feeling. The Greeks founded
no church&mdash;they formulated universal ethical and religious conceptions,
and left the development to the individual. All the great
ancient religions reached a high ethical plane and a practical monotheism,
but the Greek was the richest of all in the recognition of
the needs of humanity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_796" id="p_796">796</a></b>. <i>Rome.</i> The Roman pantheon (if the Italian divine community
can properly be called a pantheon) had not the fullness and
fineness of the Greek&mdash;in accordance with the Roman genius it
included only deities having special relations with the family and
its work and with the state.<a name="FNanchor_1370" id="FNanchor_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> The rich Roman development of
specific gods of the home is referred to above.<a name="FNanchor_1371" id="FNanchor_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a> The old nature gods
long retained their place, doubtless, in popular worship, but were
gradually subordinated to and absorbed in the larger divine figures.
And the great gods themselves began at an early time to be assimilated
to Greek deities and to assume their functions and even their
names.<a name="FNanchor_1372" id="FNanchor_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_797" id="p_797">797</a></b>. The most important of the nature gods are Sol, Luna, and
Tellus (primitive figures that soon gave way to deities divorced from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>the physical sun, moon, and earth), and the patrons of agricultural
work, Consus and Ops, Liber and Libera, Silvanus and Faunus.
The natural features represented by these deities did not disappear
entirely from the greater deities, but were purified and elevated.
Anna Perenna, for example, as representative of the round of years,
remained by the side of Janus, but he embodied this conception in
a larger civic way.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_798" id="p_798">798</a></b>. The greatest of the Roman gods, Juppiter<a name="FNanchor_1373" id="FNanchor_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a> or Jupiter, is
identical in name with Zeus, but differs from him in mythological
development and in the final form of his character. As sky-god he
was connected with atmospheric phenomena (rain and lightning)
and so naturally with wine and other crops. But as chief god of
the state he speedily rose above these connections, and as Optimus
Maximus became the representative of all Roman virtues. Along
with this native development he was in later times more or less
identified with Zeus. By his side stood the national deity Quirinus,
who remained a local patron and never rose to large proportions.
Related to him are Sancus and Dius Fidius, who represented some
primitive conceptions similar to those belonging to his early form,
but they did not develop into great gods. These three were practically
absorbed by him, but the history of this process is obscure.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_799" id="p_799">799</a></b>. Janus, the guardian of the entrance to the house (<i>janua</i>)&mdash;a
function of prime importance in early times, had a prominent
place in the cult. He was invoked at the beginning of the day, the
month, and the year; in the Salian hymn he is called "god of
gods" and "good creator"; he was served by the rex sacrorum,
who was the first in priestly dignity. He may thus have been a
chief god in the oldest Latin scheme.<a name="FNanchor_1374" id="FNanchor_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a> Yet he seems never to have
come to stand for anything intellectually or morally high except in
late philosophical thought. Though the guardian of public as well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>as private houses, he was not the patron of the city. He remained
in the cult a sort of family and clan god, and represented only the
ideas of a primitive mode of life, the great r&ocirc;le being assigned to
the sky-god.<a name="FNanchor_1375" id="FNanchor_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_800" id="p_800">800</a></b>. To judge from the old rituals Mars was in the earliest time
of which there is any record a god of vegetation. The Arval
Brothers, who were charged with the care of crops, addressed their
petitions to him, and it was to him that the Roman husbandman
prayed for a blessing on his labors.<a name="FNanchor_1376" id="FNanchor_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a> What may have been his still
earlier character we have no means of determining with certainty.
The view that he was originally a god of the fructifying sunlight<a name="FNanchor_1377" id="FNanchor_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a>
seems to rest mainly on a precarious etymology, the derivation of
his name from a stem <i>mar</i> meaning 'to shine'; but it does not
appear that ancient peoples attributed the growth of crops to the
sun.<a name="FNanchor_1378" id="FNanchor_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a> Analogy would rather lead us to regard him as an old local
deity, naturally connected with vegetation. However this may be,
the importance of agriculture for the life of the community raised
him to a position of eminence, his priestly college, the Salian (traditionally
referred to Numa), was one of the greatest, he was connected
with various departments of life, and for the warlike Romans
he naturally became the patron of war. The cult of the old war-goddess
Bellona maintained itself, but she never attained the highest
rank; she is not the equal of Mars, with whom in the later
constructions she was brought into connection. In the Hellenizing
period he was identified with Ares.<a name="FNanchor_1379" id="FNanchor_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_801" id="p_801">801</a></b>. The name Saturn is generally connected with the stem <i>sa</i>
(<i>sero</i>, <i>satum</i>, <i>sata</i>), to sow, and he is accordingly regarded as
an agricultural deity, the special patron of agricultural work.
Whether or how he differed originally from Mars is not clear&mdash;perhaps
in original differentiation of functions, he being attached to
the work of sowing, Mars to vegetation in general; or perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>they were two similar deities belonging originally to different
regions, and differentiated when brought together in the same system.
Information on this point is lacking. That Saturn was an
ancient Latin god is probable from the fact that he was traditionally
said to be an old king of Latium. Of his earliest cult in Rome
little is known. The feast that bears his name, the Saturnalia (held
on December 17 and some following days), was a time of popular
festivity, when social distinctions were laid aside (slaves were on
an equality with masters). Similar festivals are found elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1380" id="FNanchor_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a>
Midwinter, when the work of gathering in the harvest was over,
was a natural time for festivities.<a name="FNanchor_1381" id="FNanchor_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a> Saturn, or the figure from which
he arose, may have presided over this season originally, or he may
have been gradually connected with an old ceremony. The process
of Hellenizing him began early. He was identified with Kronos,
made the father of Jupiter and the head of a pre-Jovian divine
dynasty, and, in accordance with the tendency to regard the former
days as better than the present, the <i>Saturnia regna</i> became the
golden age of the past.<a name="FNanchor_1382" id="FNanchor_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> Apart from this he seems to have had no
ethical significance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_802" id="p_802">802</a></b>. In the case of certain deities, as Volcanus, Neptunus, Mercurius,
Sancus, a pronounced Roman development cannot be traced,
partly because of the lack of full data, partly, in the case of Volcan,
Neptune, and Mercury, because of an early and complete identification
with the Greek gods Hephaistos, Poseidon, and Hermes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_803" id="p_803">803</a></b>. The Roman <i>female deities</i><a name="FNanchor_1383" id="FNanchor_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a> are far less developed than the
Greek&mdash;their functions are simple, their mythological interest
small. The members of the group representing the productive
power of the earth&mdash;Bona Dea, Dea Dia, Libera, Fauna, Ceres,
Proserpina,<a name="FNanchor_1384" id="FNanchor_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a> and others&mdash;were not worked up by the Romans into
great personalities.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_804" id="p_804">804</a></b>. Juno, an independent deity, originally not the wife of Jupiter,
is, in the developed cult, the special patron of the maternal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>side of the life of women, and, as such, is a great domestic power,
the embodiment of a large part of family life. It was probably as
great sky-goddess that she attained this position&mdash;the chief female
deity is naturally the protector of women. The name came to designate
the woman's personality as childbearer, and more generally her
inner essence or self, as "genius" came to designate the male
essence.<a name="FNanchor_1385" id="FNanchor_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> Whether this usage was simply an extension of the idea
of 'protectress' to that of 'self,' an identification of woman with
her specific function in the family, or rested on some older conception,
is not clear. However this may be, she became a great
goddess, in the later construction the wife of Jupiter, and was
identified with Hera, to whom in fact she is nearly related in
function and character. Though her name appears to contain the
same stem (<i>iu</i>) as 'Jupiter,' and her epithet 'Lucina' the stem
<i>luc</i>, 'to shine,' there is no proof that she was, in early times, regarded
as a light-deity, or particularly as moon-goddess. She was
sky-goddess, but not, for that reason, necessarily light-goddess.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_805" id="p_805">805</a></b>. The importance attached by the Romans to the family life
is expressed in the cult of Vesta, the guardian of the hearth as the
center of that life.<a name="FNanchor_1386" id="FNanchor_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a> The Penates, however, the divine protectors
of the household, were no less important in the family cult than she.
The state also had its Vesta and its Penates. To this character of
sacredness stamped on the life of the private family and the
larger family, the state, ethical significance and influence must
doubtless be ascribed.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_806" id="p_806">806</a></b>. Diana appears to have originated in the time when life was
spent largely in forests, and trees were a special object of worship;
she was in historical times connected with groves.<a name="FNanchor_1387" id="FNanchor_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a> Her cult was
widely diffused in Italy, and she became (perhaps because she embodied
the common feature of the old life) the representative of
Italian unity. As great female deity she was the helper of women
in childbirth. Her name is based on the stem <i>di</i>, 'to shine,'<a name="FNanchor_1388" id="FNanchor_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a> which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>appears in 'Jupiter' and 'Juno'; but she is not a sky-goddess&mdash;the
"shining" in her case is that of trees and plants, the green
color that gleams in the light, so that the grove is called <i>lucus</i>, the
'shining mass.'<a name="FNanchor_1389" id="FNanchor_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> Diana was soon identified with Artemis, and
was endowed with her attributes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_807" id="p_807">807</a></b>. Another Italian goddess, Minerva, stood, probably, in the
earlier time for the simpler arts of a simple community&mdash;she was the
patroness of manual work and of the healing art. The expression
<i>omnis Minervae homo</i>, descriptive of a man capable in his line of
work, almost reduces her to an abstract idea. The name (as the
older form, Menerva, more clearly indicates) is based on the stem
<i>man</i> (found in Latin <i>mens</i>), and appears to mean 'endowed with
mind' (or, 'spirit'), though exactly what was the range of this
conception in the earliest times is not clear.<a name="FNanchor_1390" id="FNanchor_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> Later her function was
extended to embrace intellectual capacity, but it was not until her
identification with Athene (not later than the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)
that she attained her full cultic significance.<a name="FNanchor_1391" id="FNanchor_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_808" id="p_808">808</a></b>. Venus, though an old Italian deity (as her name and her
ancient temples show), was so early Hellenized that her proper
native development was cut short. The fact that she was in early
times the patroness of gardens<a name="FNanchor_1392" id="FNanchor_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> suggests that she was originally a
deity of the productive field; probably she belonged in the group
of goddesses (Libera, Bona Dea, and others)<a name="FNanchor_1393" id="FNanchor_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a> who presided over fertility.
It would seem that every region in Italy had such a <i>numen
loci</i> (naturally mainly agricultural). It is not clear to what particular
spot Venus was originally attached,<a name="FNanchor_1394" id="FNanchor_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> or how she came to be revered
over a wide region. Under ordinary Italian conditions she might
have become a deity like Ceres. But in Sicily, at Mount Eryx,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>according to tradition, her cult came into contact with that of
Aphrodite, whose qualities she soon assumed.<a name="FNanchor_1395" id="FNanchor_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_809" id="p_809">809</a></b>. In the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the cult of the Sicilian Venus
(Venus Erycina) was brought to Rome by direction of the Sibylline
Books, and from this time onward her advance to prominence was
continuous. As a great goddess she became (like Ishtar and
Aphrodite) in a warlike community the patron of war (Venus
Victrix). When the &AElig;neas myth was adopted in Rome she took
the place of Aphrodite as mother of that hero (who became the
founder of the Roman state), and was honored by Julius C&aelig;sar
and others as Venus Genetrix. The old Roman moral feeling
appears in the dedication of a temple (114 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) to Venus Verticordia
as atonement for the unchastity of three Vestals.<a name="FNanchor_1396" id="FNanchor_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> In general
the later functions and cult of Venus were reproductions or
imitations of those of Aphrodite. Such a divine figure, it seems,
the Romans would never have developed out of their own resources.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_810" id="p_810">810</a></b>. The general characteristics of the great ancient national
religions are indicated in the preceding descriptions. In the sacrificial
cult and the general apparatus of worship there is no important
difference between them, but they differ notably among
themselves in the construction of the divine world. The simplest
theistic system is the Chinese, which regards the world as order
controlled by Heaven. The western cults fall into two divisions,
the Egypto-Semitic and the Indo-European. The Egyptian and the
Semitic, though they differ in collateral points (divinization of kings,
idea of the future life), agree in lacking a true pantheon. On the
other hand, notwithstanding resemblances between the Hebrew and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>the Persian, the difference between the Semitic group and the Indo-European
is well-defined. This difference may be indicated by
pointing out certain peculiarities of the Semitic theistic system.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_811" id="p_811">811</a></b>. <i>Features of Semitic theism.</i> 1. Paucity of departmental
gods and absence of highly specialized gods. Of this latter class,
so prominent in Greece and Rome, there is no clear trace in Semitic
cults.<a name="FNanchor_1397" id="FNanchor_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> Departmental deities are not found in Arabia, Canaan (including
Israel and Ph&oelig;nicia), and Syria. The Hebrew Yahweh
obviously controls all departments of nature and life. The Ph&oelig;nician
Eshmun (a name of uncertain meaning) was identified by
the Greeks with their Asklepios as god of healing, but no special
function of this sort is attributed to him in Semitic records. As
he was somehow connected with the Kabiri, the "great gods,"
it is probable that he was a local divinity credited with general
powers.<a name="FNanchor_1398" id="FNanchor_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> There is more ground for recognizing real departmental
gods in Babylonia and Assyria, though even there the evidence is
not quite satisfactory. The great gods, Ea, Bel, Sin, Shamash,
Marduk, Ishtar, Ashur, preside over all human interests. Nabu
stands for agriculture as well as for wisdom, and Ea for wisdom as
well as for the great deep. Nergal is not the only god of war.
Perhaps the distinctest case of specialization is Ramman (Ninib,
Adad), the storm-god<a name="FNanchor_1399" id="FNanchor_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a>: the "thunderbolts of Im [Ramman]" are
mentioned in "The War of the Seven Evil Spirits"; yet Shamash
stands with him against the storm-spirits. In general it appears
that the recognition of special departments for gods is inchoate and
feeble in Babylonia and Assyria. There is a separate deity for the
Underworld, sometimes a goddess, sometimes a god, but they are
vague figures.<a name="FNanchor_1400" id="FNanchor_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a> The connection of certain gods with certain stars
was a late construction, and seems to have had no significance
for worship except a general deanthropomorphizing tendency.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span><b><a name="p_812" id="p_812">812</a></b>. 2. There is no trace of a cult of heroes in the Semitic
area. The Babylonian Etana, Gilgamesh, and Nimrod (an enigmatical
figure), and the Old Testament Nephilim do not receive worship.<a name="FNanchor_1401" id="FNanchor_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a>
The dead were consulted, but there was no cult of the
great ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_1402" id="FNanchor_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a> The divinization of Babylonian kings, referred to
above,<a name="FNanchor_1403" id="FNanchor_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> seems not to have carried worship with it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_813" id="p_813">813</a></b>. 3. The Semitic material of malefic spirits, while in general
the same as that found elsewhere in the world, has a couple of
special features. In Babylonia there was a sort of pandemonium,
a certain organization of demons,<a name="FNanchor_1404" id="FNanchor_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a> with proper names for some
classes; demons usually have not proper names, but may receive
such names when they come into specially definite relations with
men. The demon Lilit mentioned in the Old Testament,<a name="FNanchor_1405" id="FNanchor_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> is probably
Babylonian. The two great Hebrew hostile beings, Satan
and Azaz&#277;l, are rather gods than demons.<a name="FNanchor_1406" id="FNanchor_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a> They were both most
highly developed under Persian influence, and in the Book of Enoch
take on the character and r&ocirc;le of Angro Mainyu. Their history
exhibits, however, the disposition of the later Jews to organize the
realm of supernatural evil; about the first century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the serpent-god
of Genesis iii was identified with Satan.<a name="FNanchor_1407" id="FNanchor_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a></p>

<p>The Greek malefic beings, Ker, Harpy, Fury, Gorgon, Sphinx,
and the like, appear to have been developed out of ghosts<a name="FNanchor_1408" id="FNanchor_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a>&mdash;whether
or not this is true of the Babylonian demons the known
material does not enable us to say. Organization of such beings
was carried out fully by the Persians, but not by any other Indo-European
people and not by the Chinese.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span><b><a name="p_814" id="p_814">814</a></b>. 4. On abstract gods and phallic cults see the discussions of
these points above.<a name="FNanchor_1409" id="FNanchor_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_815" id="p_815">815</a></b>. 5. Semitic theistic myths differ from Indo-European in that
they are almost wholly without the element of personal adventures
of gods.<a name="FNanchor_1410" id="FNanchor_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a> Since all known genuine Semitic myths seem to have
their original home in Babylonia, and Babylonian mythical material
bears marks of Sumerian influence, the question has been raised
whether we have any genuinely Semitic mythical biographies of
gods. However this question may be answered, it remains true that
the Semites show little disposition to work out this line of thought.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_816" id="p_816">816</a></b>. Of the origin of these peculiarities of the Semitic theistic
system, as of all such origins, it is impossible to give any satisfactory
explanation. Geographical and climatic conditions have been
appealed to: the Semitic area was small and isolated&mdash;the Semites
were shut off by oceans, mountains, and rivers from the rest of the
world, were disposed to migrate only within the limits of their
area,<a name="FNanchor_1411" id="FNanchor_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> and long lived under the monotonous influence of the desert;
thus, it is said, their conception of the world became objective and
limited&mdash;they were clannish, practical, unanalytic, and unimaginative.
But the origin of races is obscure, and the genius of every
ancient people was formed and developed in remote ages under
conditions not known to us. We can do little more than note the
characteristics visible in historical times.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_817" id="p_817">817</a></b>. Paucity of myths and the other features mentioned above
accord with the later r&ocirc;le of Semitic, especially Hebrew, theism&mdash;the
tendency to conceive of the deity as on the one hand aloof and
transcendent, and on the other hand standing in close social relations
with man as his lord and protector. This proved to be socially the
most effective idea of God, and has been adopted by all the great
nations of the western world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_818" id="p_818">818</a></b>. The contributions of the Indo-European religions to the
religious thought of the world are indicated in the preceding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>sketches. What is to be learned from the Chinese the future must
show. The general history of civilization leads us to expect a
gradual combination and fusion of all lines of religious development,
in which every system will contribute its best, and the lower elements
will be discarded.<a name="FNanchor_1412" id="FNanchor_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>MYTHS</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_819" id="p_819">819</a></b>. Myths represent the savage and half-civilized science of
origins, the imaginary construction of the world. From the earliest
times men have shown curiosity respecting the origin of the things
that lie about them. In the presence of plains and mountains,
trees and rivers, sun, moon, and stars, beasts and human beings,
they have felt the necessity of accounting for the beginning of all
these objects.<a name="FNanchor_1413" id="FNanchor_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> This attempt at giving a natural history of the world
is in itself a scientific procedure, but in the earlier periods of humanity
it naturally attached itself to the hypothesis of superhuman
Powers&mdash;the production of this variety of mysterious things appeared
to demand capacity above that of man. The science and
the fancy of early man combined to produce a great mass of theories
and stories which to their inventors seemed to be a satisfactory
account of the origin of all things.<a name="FNanchor_1414" id="FNanchor_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_820" id="p_820">820</a></b>. Myths thus furnish an important contribution to the history
of early opinion, scientific and religious; in the absence of written
records they often offer our only means of information concerning
early thought. They describe the origin not only of the physical
world but also of communities and social organizations and institutions.
They have a noteworthy vitality, lasting from the beginning
of human communal life into periods of advanced civilization; and,
when adopted by great religious organizations and interwoven into
their theories of salvation, they perpetuate to civilized times the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>ideas of the crude period in which they originated. In many cases
they stand side by side, and in sharp contrast, with elevated moral
conceptions of the deity, and then have to be harmonized, usually
with a great expenditure of exegetical ingenuity, with the higher
ideas of society.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_821" id="p_821">821</a></b>. The mythop&oelig;ic age, in the widest sense of the term, embraces
the whole period in which appeal is made, for the explanation
of phenomena, to other than natural agencies; but it is generally
understood to extend only up to the time when, though a general
divine Power is invoked for creation, this is regarded as working
solely through the laws of nature.<a name="FNanchor_1415" id="FNanchor_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a> And within this period the
myth-making impulse lasted longer in some directions than in
others. In general, the mythical theories concerning the larger
processes, as, for example, the creation of the world, received
no addition after the establishment of a settled civilization; but
after this time even well-advanced communities continued to invent
mythical accounts of the origin of customs, institutions, genealogies,
and similar facts. Throughout the whole myth-making period
a progression may be recognized in the character of the myths:
from the earlier animal and human creators we pass to the higher
anthropomorphic forms, the great gods; there is increased literary
excellence, a molding and a remolding of the old crude stories,
with a combination of them into well-ordered histories; they are
constantly modified by the growing acquaintance with the laws of
nature and by the higher intellectual conceptions of the deity; and
they are more and more infused with ethical significance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_822" id="p_822">822</a></b>. An examination of myths all over the world shows that
the most of them, especially those relating to creation and to the
histories of the gods, originated at a period when men stood intellectually
and morally on a very low plane.<a name="FNanchor_1416" id="FNanchor_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a> The first myth-makers
were savages, with all the well-known characteristics of savage
life. Having next to no knowledge of natural law, and holding
to a practical identity of nature among men, beasts, and physical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>things, they had no difficulty in imagining all sorts of transformations
and creative procedures. No limit was conceived of for the
power of beasts and men&mdash;there was no object in heaven or earth
which, according to the current ideas, could not have been produced
by some procedure which was similar to the procedures of
ordinary life. The ethical character of the creators and of the introducers
of general culture was that of the communities that
imagined them; naturally the stories were full of ethical barbarities
and violations of all the moral rules recognized at a later period;
and, as is remarked above, these stories continued into civilized
times, and had to be interpreted by various devices.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_823" id="p_823">823</a></b>. One of the most noteworthy facts in the history of mythology
is the general similarity of the myths that are found all over
the world. Allowing for continuous moral and intellectual progress
and for local differences of surroundings, it may be said that the
theories of the production of the earth and the heavenly bodies, of
man and other objects, of customs and institutions, show substantially
the same types everywhere. The question has been raised
whether this virtual identity is to be explained by the supposition of
independent origination at various points, or is to be attributed to
a borrowing by one community from another. The question of the
migration of myths is a part of the larger question of the migration
of culture, and is attended with all the difficulties that attach to
this latter. It is not possible at present to give an answer which
shall embrace all the phenomena. Obviously any satisfactory solution
of the problem must be preceded by a thorough examination
of all particular myths, all social characteristics, and all geographical
and migratory relations affecting the early communities; and on
these points there is yet much to learn.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_824" id="p_824">824</a></b>. It is well known that customs and beliefs have sometimes
passed from one tribe or nation to another, when there has been
close social intercourse between the two. It is known also that
early men were capable of long journeys by land and by water:
the migration legends of various peoples are full of the details of
such movements; in comparatively recent times there have been
great migrations of large bodies of people, as, for example, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the Arabian desert to the north and northwest, and from the central
Asiatic steppes westward and eastward; and the tribes of the
Pacific Ocean appear to have traversed long distances in their
canoes. And when we consider the great lapse of time, many
thousands of years, that preceded the formation of the human
society with which we are acquainted, it appears to be impossible
to assign any limit to the possibility of tribal movements on the
face of the earth. On the other hand, we do not know whether,
or how far, such migrations issued in social fusion; and all the
well-attested cases of borrowing of customs and ideas have sprung
from long-continued social union.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_825" id="p_825">825</a></b>. Further, a distinction must be made between general resemblances
and minute agreement or complete identity; there may
be a similarity so great as to force on us the hypothesis of imitation,
and there may be general similarities that may be ascribed to
ordinary human thought working in different places under similar
conditions. In fact, the conditions of existence have not varied
very greatly over the globe. There are differences of climate and
soil and surface-configuration, but everywhere there have been the
sky with the heavenly bodies, the sequence of day and night, sunshine
and rain, hunting and fishing, trees, rivers, beasts and birds,
and the cultivable soil; and as man's problem was everywhere the
same&mdash;namely, how to put himself into good relation with his
surroundings&mdash;and as his intellectual equipment was everywhere
substantially the same, it would not be surprising if he should fall
on similar methods of thought and procedure independently in various
parts of the world. It was natural to early man to think of the
sun as a ball of fire which had somehow been thrown up into the
sky, and of the moon as associated with the sun as sister or wife
or husband, and of the stars as children of these two. For creative
agents early man had to look to the beings about him, particularly
to beasts, birds, and insects. The process of creation was simple&mdash;the
story usually amounts merely to saying that such and such
a beast or other being made this or that object; and there is very
rarely, if ever, a conception of an absolute beginning; almost
always a reconstruction of existing material is assumed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="p_826" id="p_826">826</a></b>. Both explanations of the resemblances in myths, it thus
appears, are reasonable in themselves, and every case must be
considered separately. That a community has borrowed one story
does not prove borrowing in the case of any other story; and that
a people has been a center of distribution of certain myths does
not prove that it was the originator of all myths. These two propositions
appear to be self-evident, but they have often been ignored
in discussions of the provenance of mythical material.<a name="FNanchor_1417" id="FNanchor_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_827" id="p_827">827</a></b>. The similarities in myths all over the world extend over
the whole domain of religion. Myths may be divided into those
which deal with the creation of the world and of man (cosmogonic),
those which deal with the origins of tribes and nations (ethnogonic),
those which refer to the origin of customs and institutions (sociogonic),
and those which are based on the forms and movements
of the heavenly bodies, clouds, winds, and so forth (solar, lunar,
procellar, and so forth).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_828" id="p_828">828</a></b>. <i>Cosmogonic myths.</i><a name="FNanchor_1418" id="FNanchor_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a> Among early tribes the creators are
very often familiar animals, such as the coyote, the raven, the hare
(North America), the wagtail (among the Ainu), the grasshopper
(among the Bushmen)&mdash;in general, whatever animals appear to the
men of a particular tribe to show skill and power. Reference is made
above to the reasons which led early men to pay such high regard
to the lower animals.<a name="FNanchor_1419" id="FNanchor_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> But in more advanced savage communities
the creative function is ascribed to a man, as among the Thompson
River Indians and in Southeast Australia; in Central Australia the
authors of creation or of the arrangement of things are beings who
are indifferently men or animals, but are regarded as the ancestors
of the tribes. In the higher religions the creators are nature gods
and great gods, and finally the one God stands alone as creator.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_829" id="p_829">829</a></b>. The act of creation is commonly represented as a process.
Mud is brought up from a pool, or an island is raised from the sea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>(the Maoris, the Redmen), and these are stretched out so as to
meet the needs of men; or a dragon or a giant is cut to pieces
and the various parts of the universe are made from the pieces
(Babylonia, India, Scandinavia); or, in still later times, an unformed
mass of water is conceived of as the original state out of which all
things are fashioned (Babylonians, Hebrews, Hindus, Greeks);
or the universe issues from an egg (the origin of the egg being
left unexplained),<a name="FNanchor_1420" id="FNanchor_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a> or the earth is represented as the mother of all
things (California). Elaborate cosmogonies are found in New
Zealand (the Maoris), in North America (the Pawnees, the Len&acirc;p&eacute;,
and so forth), in Australia, and elsewhere. An interesting example
is the Californian Achom&#257;wi cosmogony. In the beginning, according
to this scheme, were only the sea and the sky, and from the
sky came down the Creator; or a cloud, at first tiny, grew large,
condensed, and became the Silver-Gray Fox, the Creator, and out
of a fog, which in like manner was condensed, came the Coyote,
and these two made the earth and man.<a name="FNanchor_1421" id="FNanchor_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_830" id="p_830">830</a></b>. In all these cases the creation is out of already existing
material<a name="FNanchor_1422" id="FNanchor_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> and the creator is really a culture-hero or transformer, a
character that clings to deities in the most advanced religions, as
the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek. The character of these early
transformers and creators is that of the communities in which they
originate. Morally they represent both the higher and the lower
sides of life, and this is true in all periods&mdash;the Hindu Indra is as
tricksy and unmoral as the North American Coyote, and the early
form of Zeus resembles these and other savage figures.<a name="FNanchor_1423" id="FNanchor_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> The conceptions
of the creator grew more and more ethically good, but the
lower representations continued to exist side by side with the higher.<a name="FNanchor_1424" id="FNanchor_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span><b><a name="p_831" id="p_831">831</a></b>. It is not altogether strange that the two sorts of creative
Powers should be early thought of as mutually antagonistic. The
Maidu bad creator is constantly opposing and bringing to naught
the work of his good rival, and their collision produces the actual
state of things on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_1425" id="FNanchor_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> It is probably by way of explanation
of the evil in the world that in this myth the bad Coyote finally
overcomes his rival. The resemblance of this scheme to the Mazdean
dualism, except in the outcome, is obvious. For a full account
of these systems we must await further information; but at present
there is no ground for holding that the similarity is due to borrowing.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_832" id="p_832">832</a></b>. In various early cosmogonies the representation is found
of an earlier race or an early world that had been destroyed, sometimes
by a flood (Babylonia, India, Greece, Polynesia, North
America, South America), sometimes in other ways.<a name="FNanchor_1426" id="FNanchor_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a> Flood stories
probably arise from local inundations, and may therefore have been
constructed independently in various regions. In some cases the
general conditions favor the supposition of distribution from one
point: it seems probable, for example, that the Babylonian flood
story was adopted by the Canaanites and from them by the
Hebrews (the supposition of common descent from an original
Semitic myth is made improbable by the closeness of resemblance
between the Babylonian and Hebrew forms); it may have passed
to India, but the Hindu story may be accounted for from local
conditions. But we know of no such intercourse between the
Americas, Polynesia, and Western Asia, as would suggest a migration
of the myth from the latter to the two former, though this
is conceivable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_833" id="p_833">833</a></b>. The origin of man is included in that of the world. He is
made from clay or wooden figures or stones, or, as in Australia,
out of a shapeless mass. The conception found in various parts of
the world, that the present race of men was preceded by another,
appears to be due sometimes to a real, though often confused,
tradition of an earlier population, sometimes to a vague conception
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>of the conflict and incompleteness in the world. Traditions of
predecessors are found in various parts of the world. In North
America&mdash;as, for example, among the Navahos&mdash;a part of the
early history is the conflict with certain mighty and evil beings who
made good life impossible&mdash;a semidualistic scheme.<a name="FNanchor_1427" id="FNanchor_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> This view
comes from the general disposition to conceive of the past as the
time of mightier agencies, good and bad, than now exist.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_834" id="p_834">834</a></b>. A not uncommon representation is that man was originally
not mortal, or that it was a question whether or not he should be
mortal (death being generally regarded by early man as an abnormal
event, produced by supernatural agency). In such cases
mortality is brought about by an accident or an error: among
the Maoris by a mistake of the hero Maui;<a name="FNanchor_1428" id="FNanchor_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> among the Hebrews
by the disobedience of the first man, or by his failure to eat of
the tree of life; in South Africa by the accident that the messenger
who was to announce immortality was outrun by one who
announced mortality.<a name="FNanchor_1429" id="FNanchor_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_835" id="p_835">835</a></b>. The belief that the earliest men were longer-lived and of
larger stature than their successors is found among certain peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1430" id="FNanchor_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a>
Of the origin of this belief in ancient times we have no accounts.
It may have been suggested by various objects supposed to be
remains of men, or it may have been due simply to a tendency to
conceive of the beginners of human society as superior beings
(dedivinized gods). The Hebrew tradition ascribed great age to
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses, on a generally descending
scale; the longevity of the antediluvians is perhaps a speculative
continuation of the series back of Abraham on an ascending
scale, though special mythical traits here come in.</p>

<p>Connected with the general belief in the superiority of early
conditions of life is the belief in a primitive earthly paradise; the
history of this conception is not clear, but in some cases the paradise
appears to have been the delightful abode of a deity, into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>which human beings were for various reasons admitted, or the
primeval fair and happy earth.<a name="FNanchor_1431" id="FNanchor_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_836" id="p_836">836</a></b>. The belief that the world or the existing order is to be
destroyed appears to be connected with the conception of history
as involving a cycle of ages, and the theory of ages may have arisen
from the tradition or the knowledge of social and political revolutions,
the rise of each new phase of civilization involving the destruction
of its predecessor. Traditions of past cataclysms may
have helped toward the formulation of an expectation of coming
destruction. This expectation, generalized under the influence of
belief in a final judgment of men by God, would lead to the announcement
of a final destruction of the present world. This destruction,
which ushers in a new age, is accomplished in various
ways, sometimes by water, wind, or fire,<a name="FNanchor_1432" id="FNanchor_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a> sometimes by supernatural
enemies.<a name="FNanchor_1433" id="FNanchor_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> The Hindu and the Persian schemes of successive ages

the older idea that present things must have an end.<a name="FNanchor_1434" id="FNanchor_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> The Navaho

<p><b><a name="p_837" id="p_837">837</a></b>. Many other cosmogonic details, common to various peoples,
might be added. Transformation from human to animal or mineral
forms and the reverse are to be found, as we have seen, everywhere.
The slaying of dragons by gods or heroes is often connected
with creation, but belongs sometimes in the category of
cultural or nature myths. Abnormal forms of birth and generation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>may be sometimes products of savage fancy, or they may be attempts
to set forth the mysterious or the supernatural in certain
beings, or they may be nature myths: in various mythologies a
god or a hero is born from the side or the thigh or the head of
the mother or the father; fecundation by other means than sexual
union appears in North America, Egypt, Greece, and generally in
savage tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1436" id="FNanchor_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> The representation of the primeval parents, Heaven
and Earth, as having been originally united in a close embrace
and then separated, Heaven being lifted up and Earth remaining
below, is so remarkable that it might be doubted whether it arose
independently in different places; yet, as it is found in New Zealand,<a name="FNanchor_1437" id="FNanchor_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a>
in Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_1438" id="FNanchor_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> in India,<a name="FNanchor_1439" id="FNanchor_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a> among the Masai of Eastern Central
Africa,<a name="FNanchor_1440" id="FNanchor_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> and as the supposition of borrowing for these widely separated
communities would be difficult (except, perhaps, as between
Egypt and the Masai land), it is simpler to regard the myth as a
natural effort of early science.<a name="FNanchor_1441" id="FNanchor_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a> It need hardly be added that with
all the similarities in the various cosmogonic systems the diversities
among different peoples are as numerous as the differences of surroundings
and character.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_838" id="p_838">838</a></b>. Among most early communities the great figures of the
past (creations of imagination) to whom are ascribed the introduction
of the arts of life and the general betterment of society are
regarded as demigods, descended from parents one of whom is
divine and the other human; it is sometimes the father, sometimes
the mother, that is divine.<a name="FNanchor_1442" id="FNanchor_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> This conception is a simple and
natural explanation of the supposed extraordinary powers of the
personages in question. A more refined conception represents
man as receiving life from the breath of God,<a name="FNanchor_1443" id="FNanchor_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a> whence easily
comes the idea that man is the child of God and has in him
a spark of divinity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span><b><a name="p_839" id="p_839">839</a></b>. <i>Ethnogonic myths.</i> Early science has to account not only
for the origin of the world and the human race, but also for the
origin of particular tribes and their surroundings. The area involved
is the known world, which among savage peoples is small in extent
but increases with knowledge, the general method of accounting
for social division remaining, however, the same. As a rule,
the center of the distribution of mankind is the territory of the
particular tribe in which the myth originates. There is always the
conviction, expressed or implied, that the tribe in question is the
center of the world and the favorite of the creative Power;<a name="FNanchor_1444" id="FNanchor_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> it
being established in its place, the rest of the world is divided
among other tribes&mdash;a conception that survives among civilized
peoples of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_1445" id="FNanchor_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_840" id="p_840">840</a></b>. The ethnogonic history generally takes the form of a genealogy&mdash;every
tribe or other group is derived from a mythical
ancestor, who among savages is frequently a beast, or half-beast
half-human, or even in some cases a rock or a stone. Familiar
examples are the genealogical systems of the Australians, the
Maoris of New Zealand, the Samoans, the American Indians;<a name="FNanchor_1446" id="FNanchor_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a>
but the conception appears to be universal. There was indeed no
other natural way of accounting for the origin of a tribe: as an
existing family would reckon its beginning from the grandfather,
so the tribe would come from some remote person, and so at a
later time the nation, and then finally the human race. As there
were no historical records of such beginning, the scientific imagination
of early peoples constructed the first parents in various
ways, often by personifying the tribe and transferring its name to
the mythical ancestor. It is in this way that the genealogical lists
of the post-Mohammedan Arabians arose; it is certain that they
had no records of the past extending further than a few generations,
and in some cases the origins of the names in genealogical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>lists may be fixed. The Greek method of naming ancestors is
simple and obvious: the sons of Hellen are Dorus, Xuthus, &AElig;olus;
the sons of Xuthus are Ach&aelig;us and Ion; and these are all descended
from Deucalion. In like manner the Pelasgians are carried
back to the ancestor Pelasgus, and the Peloponnesians to Pelops.
The Roman Romulus, Remulus, Remus, are natural inventions
based on the name of the city.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_841" id="p_841">841</a></b>. Genealogical elaboration was carried out more fully by
the Hebrews than by any other ancient people. Not only were
tribal names, Jacob, Israel, Judah, Joseph, Ephraim, and the rest,
personified, but they were arranged in a well-shaped family system;
and, the same method being applied to all the nations known to
them, these were carried up to the three sons of Noah, and finally
through Noah up to the first man, whose Hebrew name, Adam,
means simply man.<a name="FNanchor_1447" id="FNanchor_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> The table of nations in Genesis x is a remarkable
example of ethnographic organization. As it is based on
geographical relations, it does not in all particulars accord with
modern ethnological schemes, but it is a noteworthy attempt to
embrace the whole world in a family picture. The view that the
division of the earth among the various peoples revolved around
the Israelite territory is expressed in the poem cited above,<a name="FNanchor_1448" id="FNanchor_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> which
is of the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and it may be inferred that this
large genealogical unification was completed among the Israelites
at a time when they felt the influence of the great Assyrian civilization,
with which they seem to have come into somewhat intimate
contact. Later examples are found in Vergil's &AElig;neid and Milton's
"History of Britain" (in which he adopts early attempts at genealogical
construction).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_842" id="p_842">842</a></b>. <i>Sociogonic myths.</i> Most of the customs and institutions of
early peoples go back to a time when there were no records, and
their introduction was naturally referred, so soon as reflection
thereon began, to gods and heroes of primeval time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span><b><a name="p_843" id="p_843">843</a></b>. The arts of life are commonly explained in this mythical

the Little One or to Qat, in Mexico to the god or culture-hero
Quetzalcoatl, in Peru to Viracocha or Pachacamac, or to Manco
Capac and his wife. For the Algonkins Michabo, the Great Hare,
was the teacher of fishing and of other pursuits.<a name="FNanchor_1449" id="FNanchor_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> The Babylonian

in the Book of Genesis<a name="FNanchor_1452" id="FNanchor_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a> as the culture-heroes of the olden
time. The introduction of writing into Greece is ascribed by the
Greeks to the mythical hero or demigod Cadmus.<a name="FNanchor_1453" id="FNanchor_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a> Fire is in India
the production of the god Agni<a name="FNanchor_1454" id="FNanchor_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> (who is simply fire elevated to
the rank of a personal divinity); in the Greek myth it is stolen
and given to men by the demigod Prometheus<a name="FNanchor_1455" id="FNanchor_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a> against the will
of the gods, who are jealous of human progress.<a name="FNanchor_1456" id="FNanchor_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a> Among various

<p><b><a name="p_844" id="p_844">844</a></b>. Early ceremonies, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_1458" id="FNanchor_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> are universally connected
with religion, and their origin is ascribed to divine or semi-divine
figures of the past. In Australia the initiation ceremonies,
which take up a great part of the tribal life, are regarded as
having been established by the mythical ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_1459" id="FNanchor_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a> Among the

Abraham, who is said to have acted by direct command of God,<a name="FNanchor_1461" id="FNanchor_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a>

The ritual dances of the North American Indians, which are very
elaborate, are accompanied by explanations in which the origin of
every detail is referred to some event or person in the supernatural
past;<a name="FNanchor_1463" id="FNanchor_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a> and similar explanations are given of the dances of Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_1464" id="FNanchor_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a>
In many cases the restrictions of food and other things are ascribed
to the experiences of the ancestors or to the commands of deities:
the Hebrew usage of not eating a certain sinew is connected with
the story of the struggle between Jacob and a divine being.<a name="FNanchor_1465" id="FNanchor_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_845" id="p_845">845</a></b>. Festivals also were treated in this manner as soon as men
began to reflect on the origin of society. As one feature in the
festival sacred to Mars (March 1) was the dancing of the priests
who carried curious shields, it was narrated, to account for this,
that the shield of Mars fell down from heaven;<a name="FNanchor_1466" id="FNanchor_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> and the goddess
Maia, according to one conjecture, was invented to explain the

children at a later period were not called by the mother's name
was that in the contest between Poseidon and Athene for the
control of the city of Athens the latter deity prevailed by the votes
of the women, who were in the majority, and to appease the wrath
of Poseidon this rule was then made by the men.<a name="FNanchor_1468" id="FNanchor_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> The Gileadite
festival in which maidens lamented the death of the daughter of

the succor given by Theseus against the Amazons,<a name="FNanchor_1470" id="FNanchor_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> and in the

proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_1471" id="FNanchor_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> In the Old Testament the spring festival (Passover)
is connected with the departure of the people from Egypt, and the
autumn festival (Tabernacles) with the sojourn in the wilderness;

Pentecost) was similarly brought into connection with the giving
of the law on Mount Sinai.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_846" id="p_846">846</a></b>. <i>Relation between myth and ritual.</i> The question whether
myth comes from ritual or ritual from myth has been much discussed.
Obviously universal precedence cannot be allowed to either
of the two. There are cases in which primary mythical beliefs
determine the form of religious procedure: the belief, for example,
that a god, as anthropomorphic divine patron, must be placated
and provided with all the accessories of a potentate, leads to the
offering of food and other gifts and to the establishment of abodes
and attendants; the sense of his aloofness and of his powerful and
dangerous qualities induces cautionary rules for approach to his
presence; because he has manlike intellectual and emotional limitations
his favor must be secured by prayers and praises; if he has
a son, this latter may act as mediator between his father and a suppliant,
or one god may mediate with others in behalf of men.<a name="FNanchor_1472" id="FNanchor_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> On the
other hand, there are many examples of myths that arise as explanation
of ritualistic details.<a name="FNanchor_1473" id="FNanchor_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> It is sometimes hard to say on which side
the precedence in time lies. In general, it seems, it is from broader
and fundamental mythical conceptions that ritual arises, while
mythical narratives spring from particular ritualistic observances.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_847" id="p_847">847</a></b>. Important religious changes which have come to pass
through natural changes of thought, usually by the movement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>toward greater refinement, are explained as having been introduced
by some great reformer. The abrogation of human sacrifice
was a reform of great moment: in Mexico it is ascribed to the
god Quetzalcoatl,<a name="FNanchor_1474" id="FNanchor_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> and in the Old Testament to Abraham acting
by command of God.<a name="FNanchor_1475" id="FNanchor_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> One of the Incas of Peru is said to have
reached monotheistic views by a process of reasoning, and the post-Biblical
Jewish myths ascribed the same achievement to Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_1476" id="FNanchor_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_848" id="p_848">848</a></b>. As a rule sacred places were connected with stories of
the presence of divine personages or mythical ancestors. In Samoa,
the Hawaian group, and other Pacific Islands many stones are
connected with stories of heroes, spirits, or gods.<a name="FNanchor_1477" id="FNanchor_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> In Central Australia
every stone, rock, or tree has its myth of the half-bestial
ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_1478" id="FNanchor_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a> In Greece, as Pausanias relates, there was hardly a
place that did not have its story of the origin of some sacred spot
or thing due to a god.<a name="FNanchor_1479" id="FNanchor_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> In the earlier books of the Old Testament
the sacred places, which were Arabian or Canaanite shrines adopted
by the Hebrews, are generally connected with the presence of
the patriarchs or other great men. The magical qualities of springs,
pools, and other bodies of water are explained by stories in which
a god or other divine person descends into them, or in some other
way communicates power.<a name="FNanchor_1480" id="FNanchor_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_849" id="p_849">849</a></b>. <i>Myths of heavenly bodies, winds, and vegetation.</i> As the
sun, the moon, and other objects of nature were regarded as anthropomorphic
persons and naturally came into relation with men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>their imagined adventures have produced a great mass of stories
in all parts of the world. These stories are partly attempts to
account for phenomena and partly are simply products of fancy;
the myth-maker is very often a mere story-teller. The sun, conceived
of usually as an old man, is supposed to live in a house up
in the sky, to have his wife and children, to receive visitors, and
to interfere to some extent in human affairs. An eclipse was obviously
to be regarded as the work of an enemy of the sun, usually
a dragon (so in many low tribes, and in India). A great excess of
heat on the earth might be explained by the supposition that the
chariot of the sun had been driven too near the surface.<a name="FNanchor_1481" id="FNanchor_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a> The
waning of the moon was supposed to be due to her sorrow at
the loss of her children, the stars, which were devoured by the sun.
The moon might be a fair woman who becomes enamored of
a human being. At a later time in the progress of astronomical
knowledge the planets and certain of the stars were individualized&mdash;they
became actors in human history or, still later, the abode of
supernatural beings.<a name="FNanchor_1482" id="FNanchor_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_850" id="p_850">850</a></b>. The beginnings of astrological theory are probably to be
recognized at a very early period. The height of the sky above
the earth, the persistence with which the stars seem to look down
on men, the invariability of their courses, the mysteriousness of
their origin would naturally lead to the belief that they had some
control over human affairs. Meteors, regarded as falling stars,
have always been objects of dread. The development of astrology
has been due to the increase of astronomical knowledge and to
the tendency to organize religion in its aspect of dependence on
the supernatural Powers.<a name="FNanchor_1483" id="FNanchor_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_851" id="p_851">851</a></b>. Winds have played a less prominent part in theistic history
than the heavenly bodies, but have given rise to not a few myths
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>in religions of different grades of culture and in different parts of
the world.<a name="FNanchor_1484" id="FNanchor_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> In the Scandinavian myths the storm wind as a representative
of the prevailing climatic condition has assumed special
prominence. In the Iliad when a messenger is dispatched to the
abode of the winds to secure their aid, these are found feasting
like a human family.<a name="FNanchor_1485" id="FNanchor_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a> Later, winds are, of course, subordinated
to the great gods.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_852" id="p_852">852</a></b>. From time to time theories have arisen explaining many
deities and heroes as representatives of the heavenly bodies, and
many stories of gods and heroes as reflecting the phenomena of
the sky or the air. Such theories have been carried so far sometimes
as to explain everything in mythology as a solar or lunar
or astral myth. These constructions leave much to the fancy, and
it is not difficult to find in mythical narratives references to the
movements of the sun or the moon or the stars or the winds.
It is possible that such reference really exists in certain stories. It
is probable also that simple myths representing such phenomena
have been in later times elaborated and brought into connection
with a more detailed astronomical knowledge. The same principles
of interpretation should guide us here as are referred to above.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_853" id="p_853">853</a></b>. There are doubtless cases in which a hero or a god represents
the sun or the moon, the correspondence between the adventures
of the hero and the movements of the heavenly bodies
being plain. The twelve labors of Heracles may represent the
passage of the sun through the twelve signs of the zodiac; but if
this be the case, it is certain that such construction was relatively
late, and that the separate adventures must be referred to some
more simple facts. If Heracles slays the Hydra, it is more natural
to regard this as having represented originally some mundane
phenomenon of nature or some simple conflict of the savage life.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>The same thing is probably true of the adventures of the Babylonian
hero Gilgamesh, who is sometimes considered to be the original of
Heracles. Nothing is easier than to expound the story of Samson
in the Old Testament as a series of solar and other phenomena,<a name="FNanchor_1486" id="FNanchor_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a>
but the probability is that he embodies the vague recollections of
early tribal adventures, and, notwithstanding his name (which means
'solar,' that is, devoted to the sun), there is no good ground for
supposing that his history has been astronomically worked over.
A similar remark applies to many discussions respecting various
deities, Hindu (as Indra), Egyptian (as Osiris), Semitic (as Nergai,
Marduk, Nabu), and Greek (as Apollo). In all such cases it is
necessary to inquire first whether the explanation of the myth may
not be found naturally in some ordinary human experience or some
very simple natural phenomenon, and a line of demarcation must
be drawn between original forms of the myth and later learned
constructions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_854" id="p_854">854</a></b>. Another source of mythical narration is the history of
vegetation, which at the present time has largely supplanted the
solar theory. The amazing spectacle of the decay and revival of
vegetation, naturally referred to superhuman power, and the importance
of plants for human life, have led to the construction
of stories (sometimes founded on ritual) in which the adventures
of the spirit of vegetation are recounted. Obviously there is a
sound basis for this view. The earth was necessarily regarded as
the mother from whom came the corn and wine that supported
human life. The study of the relatively modern European ceremonies<a name="FNanchor_1487" id="FNanchor_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a>
has brought out the persistence of such an idea, and the
similarity between the new ceremonies and the old may be said
to have demonstrated the existence of an early cult of the divine
Power controlling vegetation.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_855" id="p_855">855</a></b>. The Asian Magna Mater and the Greek Mother (Demeter)
or Maiden (Kore, Persephone) are identical in function with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>corn maiden of modern times, and the latter figure may be a degraded
or socialized descendant of an early deity. When we add
that ancient local deities all took account of the products of the
soil, it will not seem improbable that a great mass of stories should
have arisen describing the adventures of the Spirit of Vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_1488" id="FNanchor_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a>
The descent of a hero or a god into Hades may be explained as
the passage of the sun from its summer warmth to its winter feebleness,
or as the annual death and revival of vegetation. Which of these
views shall be adopted will depend in any case on the particular
coloring of the story, on the signification of the names involved, or
on the ceremonies accompanying the worship. It is not now possible
to frame a theory that shall embrace all possible phenomena.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_856" id="p_856">856</a></b>. Certain great myths have in the course of time taken on
elaborate literary form, and in this form show traces of advanced
thought on some fundamental questions. Such myths occur among
half-civilized peoples. There is, for example, the great mythical
cosmogony of the Maoris of New Zealand&mdash;a scheme seemingly
so philosophic in form that it excites wonder as to how it could
have arisen in such a place.<a name="FNanchor_1489" id="FNanchor_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> The story of the adventures of Maui,
a general Polynesian figure, constitutes a Polynesian history of the
rise of civilization. Among the North American Indians the mythological
systems of the Algonkins, the Pawnees, and other tribes,
include the origin of all forms of natural objects and all institutions
of society. The histories of the Great Hare of the Len&acirc;p&eacute;, the
Thunder Bird of the West, and the various transformers or culture-heroes,
are scarcely less elaborate than the New Zealand stories.
The mythologies of the Finns also (given in the Kalevala) are
noteworthy. Passing to higher forms, it is sufficient to note the
suggestive story of Balder among the Scandinavians, and, in the
ancient world, the Egyptian Osiris myth, the Great Dragon myth of
the Babylonian cosmogony, the various forms of the story of a
primeval paradise, and the ceremonies and ideas that have arisen
in connection with the death of a god.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span><b><a name="p_857" id="p_857">857</a></b>. The motif of the <i>antagonism between light and darkness</i>
appears to be attached to or involved in certain myths, especially
the great cosmogonies and stories in which solar deities figure
prominently. The original unformed mass of matter is often, perhaps
generally, conceived of as being in darkness, and its transformation
is attended with the appearance of light<a name="FNanchor_1490" id="FNanchor_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a>&mdash;light is an
essential element in the conditions that make earthly human life
possible; in contrast with the Upperworld the Underworld is dark.
The diffusion of light is a main function of the sun, and the high
gods dwell in continual brightness.<a name="FNanchor_1491" id="FNanchor_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> Light is the symbol of right,
security, and happiness. But it is doubtful whether the expression
of the antithesis and conflict of light and darkness is the immediate
object of the early portraitures of deities and the mythical narratives
of creation and the future of the world. The Egyptian Ra
has no conflict with darkness, and the struggle between Osiris (and
Horus) and Set, while it may be and often is interpreted in this
sense, is susceptible of other interpretations. The motif in the
Babylonian cosmogony is the bringing of order out of disorder, in
which work the creation of light is an incident. In ethically advanced
religious systems, such as the Hindu and the Persian, the
good Powers are connected with light and the wicked Powers with
darkness, but a conflict between these adjuncts is not brought out
clearly. No such conflict appears in Greek mythology. Where a
supernatural being intervenes in defense of light (as when a god
destroys a dragon-creature who attempts to swallow the sun), this
is simply an explanation of a physical phenomenon, and not a
conflict between light and darkness.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_858" id="p_858">858</a></b>. The theory, widely held, that a great body of early myths,
including the conception of the characters and functions of many
deities, represent the struggle between light and darkness, is, therefore,
not sustained by the facts. Such a generalization is found in
late philosophic systems, but it does not belong to early religious
thought, which deals with concrete personal agents.<a name="FNanchor_1492" id="FNanchor_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> A conflict
between two gods is often to be explained as the rivalry of two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>districts or of two forms of culture. Attacks on luminous bodies,
or defenses of them, are common as &aelig;tiological myths, and an
antagonism between light and darkness then naturally appears, as
is observed above, as an accessory or incident, but not as an immediate
object of mythical portraiture. The closeness of the
relation between the light-and-darkness theory and the solar theory
of myths is obvious.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_859" id="p_859">859</a></b>. <i>Myth and legend.</i> In the course of the formulation of
myths they have naturally become mingled with legend. As they
narrate the achievements of the great supernatural figures of the
past, these achievements have often become blended in the twilight
of tradition with actual (though embellished) experiences of the
clan or tribe and of the great men therewith connected.<a name="FNanchor_1493" id="FNanchor_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> In such
cases it is generally difficult to decide where legend ends and myth
begins, and every story must be investigated separately, and its
nature determined from what is known of the real history of the
time and of the development of mythical ideas. Familiar examples
of this combination of legend and myth appear in connection with
the Homeric poems, certain Asian and Greek cults, and the early
histories of Greece and Rome and Israel.<a name="FNanchor_1494" id="FNanchor_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a> The elucidation of such
narratives must be left to the technical investigator in the various
historical periods. In general, it may be said, there is enough historical
material to enable us to trace the development of tribes and
nations with a fair degree of certainty; and the caution already
expressed against excessive mythological interpretation is especially
in place in such researches.<a name="FNanchor_1495" id="FNanchor_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a></p>

<p>The material published under the general title of "folk-lore"
consists of various elements&mdash;purely religious usages and ideas,
mythical and legendary narratives, and fanciful stories. As the
term, defined precisely, refers only to popular survivals from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>defunct religious systems, its material shows a constant process of
modification from generation to generation by newer ideas. The
mythical element, extricated from the general mass, must be treated
in accordance with the general principles of the criticism of myths.<a name="FNanchor_1496" id="FNanchor_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_860" id="p_860">860</a></b>. <i>Mythical biographies.</i> As gods and heroes are the actors
in mythical constructions of society, the stories in such constructions
generally assume the form of anecdotal biographies of these
personages. Such sketches gather fresh material from generation
to generation, are gradually worked up into literary shape, and,
being brought into connection with historical traditions, assume
historical form, and are then sometimes accepted in their homes
and elsewhere as historical.<a name="FNanchor_1497" id="FNanchor_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> As they embody the ideas of the
times in which they originate, they have, in so far, historical and
psychological value. Charm of style has given some of these
stories literary value, and they have been accepted as part of the
literary treasure of the world. They are sometimes combinations
or fusions of myth and legend, and these two elements are not
always easily distinguishable the one from the other.<a name="FNanchor_1498" id="FNanchor_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_861" id="p_861">861</a></b>. In questions that touch the original nature of a god the
possible difference between earlier and later conceptions of him
must, of course, be borne in mind. When a deity has been definitely
shaped and has become a patron of a community, he may
be identified by the people, or particularly by poets and priests,
with any object or idea that is of special interest to the community.
The baals of the agricultural Canaanites presided over irrigation,
but were not specifically underground gods;<a name="FNanchor_1499" id="FNanchor_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a> they were rather
general divine patrons interested in all that interested the people.
A solar deity, becoming the favorite god of an agricultural community,
may be regarded as connected with vegetation; or a god
of vegetation may be associated, in astronomical circles, with the
sun. A divine figure is often composite, the product of the coalescence
of several orders of ideas. In general it may be said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>the simplest and least socially refined function of a god is likely to
indicate his original character. We must go behind the conceptions
of cultivated times to the hints given in popular observances
and poetry.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_862" id="p_862">862</a></b>. <i>Interpretation of myths.</i> For savage and half-civilized communities,
and for the masses in civilized times, the stories of the
achievements and adventures of gods, heroes, and ancestors, accepted
as history, have been and are sources of enjoyment and of
intellectual impulse. Narrated by fathers to their families, and
recited or sung by professional orators and poets to groups and
crowds throughout the land,<a name="FNanchor_1500" id="FNanchor_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> they have been expanded and handed
down from generation to generation, receiving from every generation
the coloring of its experiences and ideas, and in the course
of time have taken literary shape under the hands of men of
genius, and have been committed to writing. For the early times
they not only formed a body of historical literature, but also, since
they described relations between men and gods, came to be somewhat
vague yet real sacred scriptures of the people.<a name="FNanchor_1501" id="FNanchor_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> As such,
being regarded simply as statements of facts, they needed no outside
interpretation; and being molded by human experience, they
carried with them such moral and religious instruction as grew
naturally out of the situations described. A more highly cultivated
age, dissatisfied with bald facts, desired to find in the stories the
wisdom of the fathers, and the imagination of poets and philosophers
was long occupied with discovering and expounding their
deeper meanings till further research set aside such attempts as
useless. The treatment of mythical material thus shows three
stadia: the acceptance of myths as genuine history; esoteric explanations
of their assumed profound teachings; and finally, return
to their original character as primitive science, having their origin
in crude conceptions of life. A brief sketch may show how the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>interpretation of myths has come to be regarded as an historical
and sociological science.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_863" id="p_863">863</a></b>. <i>Ancient interpretations of myths.</i> When the progress of
thought, especially in Greece, made it impossible to accept the
current beliefs concerning gods and their doings, it was felt necessary
to put some higher meaning into them&mdash;they were rationalized
and spiritualized by a process of allegorization. This process seems
to have begun in Greece as early as the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_1502" id="FNanchor_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> It was
the philosophers who undertook to reinterpret the Homeric mythical
material, and the extent to which this procedure had been carried
in the time of Plato is indicated by the fact that he ridicules these
modes of dealing with the poet.<a name="FNanchor_1503" id="FNanchor_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> But Homer maintained his place
in literature, and the demand for a spiritualizing of his works increased
rather than diminished. A science of allegory was created,
Pergamus became one of its chief centers,<a name="FNanchor_1504" id="FNanchor_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> and the Alexandrian
Jew Philo applied the method to the interpretation of the Pentateuch.
It was speedily adopted in the Christian world, and has
there maintained itself, though in diminishing extent, up to the
present day.<a name="FNanchor_1505" id="FNanchor_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a> As a serious interpretation of ancient myths, outside
of the Old Testament, it is no longer employed. Myths are, indeed,
important as reflecting early opinions, religious and other&mdash;good
doctrinal matter may be extracted from them, but this must
not be ascribed to the intention of their authors and reporters. In
the Old Testament itself the Jewish editors have socialized the
mythical material (weaving it into the history, as in Genesis), or
have brought it under the work of the national deity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_864" id="p_864">864</a></b>. <i>Recent interpretations.</i> In recently proposed interpretations
we may note first certain attempts at a <i>unification</i> of some body
of myths or of all known mythical material. These attempts,
almost without exception, take the sky and the heavenly bodies
as their basis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span></p><p>At the end of the eighteenth century, when the theory of human
unity had taken hold of the French revolutionists, C. F. Dupuis<a name="FNanchor_1506" id="FNanchor_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a>
undertook to explain all the cults of the world as having come
from the worship of the universe&mdash;a conception broad enough
to cover everything; but he practically reduces it to the worship
of the heavenly bodies, particularly the sun, and derives all myths
from stellar objects. His work is ingenious, learned, and suggestive,
but in his day the facts of ancient mythology were insufficiently
known.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_865" id="p_865">865</a></b>. In the next century the study of Sanskrit and Old Persian
widened the field of knowledge, the science of Indo-European
grammar was created, and on this followed attempts at the construction
of an Indo-European mythology. The first definitely
formulated unification was the theory of F. Max M&uuml;ller,<a name="FNanchor_1507" id="FNanchor_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> which
derived all Aryan (Indo-European) myths from phenomena of the
sun and the dawn, largely, he held, through misunderstandings of
the meaning of old descriptive terms (myths as a "disease of
language"). It is conceivable that a word, originally used simply
as descriptive of an actual fact, may have passed into a proper
name and become personalized and the center of adventures; but
the character of early man's thought, as we now know it, makes
it impossible to regard such a view as a probable explanation of
the mass of mythological material. M&uuml;ller's services to the science
of the history of religions were great, but his theory of the origin
of myths has now been generally abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_1508" id="FNanchor_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_866" id="p_866">866</a></b>. The great discoveries of literary material made in Egypt
and Babylonia since the middle of the nineteenth century have
aroused special interest in the religions of these countries. Leadership
in ancient civilization is claimed by Egyptologists and Assyriologists,
each party for its own land. It is, however, Babylonia that
has given rise to the largest theories of the unity of myths&mdash;a
fact due in part to its development of astronomy, in part, perhaps,
to the resemblance between the Babylonian mythical material and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>that of the Old Testament. Dupuis<a name="FNanchor_1509" id="FNanchor_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> had observed that the ancient
Chaldeans taught that the heavenly bodies controlled mundane
destinies, and, according to Diodorus, that the planets were the interpreters
of the will of the gods. This is substantially the point
of view of E. Stucken,<a name="FNanchor_1510" id="FNanchor_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> who, in common with Dupuis (though, apparently,
independently), holds to the unity of ancient religions and
the astral origin of all myths. From Babylonia, he thinks, myths
passed to all parts of the world, Egypt, Asia, Europe, Polynesia,
and America&mdash;in such migrations, however, it was the motif that
passed; the personages might vary in different lands.<a name="FNanchor_1511" id="FNanchor_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a> Finally he
traces all sagas of all peoples to the creation myth.<a name="FNanchor_1512" id="FNanchor_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> This supreme
unification is reached by arguments so far-fetched as to deprive
them of force.</p>

<p>Stucken's position was adopted and elaborated by H. Winckler,
who was followed by A. Jeremias and some others.<a name="FNanchor_1513" id="FNanchor_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> Winckler
attempts to show that a single religion existed in the ancient Oriental
world (with a single system of myths), and that this was
dominated by the conception that there was a correspondence between
the heavenly world and the lower world in such wise that
all earthly affairs were indicated by the movements of the heavenly
bodies, whence arose the whole religious system of Western Asia
and Greece.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_867" id="p_867">867</a></b>. What is true in this theory (to which the name of "Panbabylonianism"
has been given) is that Semitic mythology is a
unit, with Babylonia as its birthplace, and that certain elements are
common to the Egyptian, Semitic, Greek, and other mythological
systems. The substantial identity of Babylonian, Aramean (Syrian),
and Canaanite myths is generally acknowledged:<a name="FNanchor_1514" id="FNanchor_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a> the Old Testament
dragon-myth (which occurs also in the New Testament
Apocalypse) is found in full shape only in Babylonian material;<a name="FNanchor_1515" id="FNanchor_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>the Syrian Adonis myth is at bottom the Babylonian story of
Tammuz and Ishtar. The probability is that all early Semitic
schemes of creation and prehistoric life are essentially one. Further,
such conceptions as the origin of the world from an unshaped mass
of matter and the origin of man from the earth are widely distributed
over the earth.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_868" id="p_868">868</a></b>. Babylonia, then, is the chief mythop&oelig;ic center for the
Semitic region, but we are not warranted in extending its influence
as myth-maker beyond this region. The myths of the Indo-European
peoples have in general the stamp of independent creation.
Loans there may be (as, for example, in the myths connected
with Aphrodite and Heracles, and perhaps others), but these do
not affect the character of the whole. The relation between the
Semitic and the Egyptian mythologies is still under discussion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_869" id="p_869">869</a></b>. The astral element of the theory, based on arbitrary parallelisms
carried out without regard to historical conditions, is an
unauthorized extension of the generally accepted fact that certain
myths are astral. Winckler's assumption of an astral "system"
that obtained throughout the Western world is supported only by
unproved assertions of the sort just referred to.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_870" id="p_870">870</a></b>. Jensen's contention that all myths come from the Babylonian
Gilgamesh story<a name="FNanchor_1516" id="FNanchor_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a> exhibits the same general method as the
theories of Stucken and Winckler (giving assertion in place of proof),
differing from them only in the material of comparisons.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_871" id="p_871">871</a></b>. The fundamental vice of these theories (apart from the
arbitrary character of the assertions made by their authors) is the
failure to take into account the historical development of mythical
conceptions, their beginnings in the rudest periods of human
thought, and their gradual elaboration and distinct formulation in
the great communities, in which process, along with the varieties
of local conditions, certain fundamental resemblances remain
throughout.<a name="FNanchor_1517" id="FNanchor_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_872" id="p_872">872</a></b>. Besides these more prominent or more definitely formulated
theories there has been in some quarters a disposition to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>insist too strongly on lines of mythical development connected with
the plant world, particularly with the death and revival of vegetation.
All that we know of the history of mythical material among
existing savages and in the earliest forms of belief of civilized
nations forbids the limitation of the origin of myths to any one
department of nature or to any one part of the world. Myths,
like gods, may be composite: of this nature, probably, are some
cosmogonic histories,<a name="FNanchor_1518" id="FNanchor_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> and the stories of Gilgamesh, Heracles,
Perseus, and many others. The lines of origin mentioned above
have, naturally, in some cases, coalesced, and their combination
into single coherent narratives has been spread over long periods
of time. For this reason there is always need of detailed investigations
of particular myths as a preparation for a general history
of mythology.<a name="FNanchor_1519" id="FNanchor_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_873" id="p_873">873</a></b>. <i>Modern critical methods in the interpretation of myths.</i> The
treatment of myths has followed the general course of the development
of thought in the world. In the old national religions they
were incorporated in the substance of the religious beliefs. The
reformers of thought either ignored them (so, for example, Confucius
and Buddha), or denounced their absurdities (so Plato and
others), or allegorized or rationalized them (so many Greek philosophers);
the early Christian writers treated Old Testament
myths as history, and ridiculed the myths of Greece and Rome.
During the long period when the European peoples were assimilating
the ideas of Christianity the study of myths remained in
abeyance. After the classical revival there was a return to the
allegorizing method, the fondness for which has not yet completely
died out.<a name="FNanchor_1520" id="FNanchor_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_874" id="p_874">874</a></b>. The extension of knowledge in the eighteenth century
gave an impetus to the study of religion, the results of which
for mythological investigation appear in the works of Dupuis
and others.<a name="FNanchor_1521" id="FNanchor_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a> These authors were necessarily ignorant of many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>important facts, but they have the merit of having collected much
material, which they treated as something that had to be explained
in accordance with the laws of human thought.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_875" id="p_875">875</a></b>. The turning-point in the development of mythological
science was the rise of the modern critical study of history, begun
by Voltaire and Gibbon and carried on by Niebuhr and others.
A vigorous group of writers arose in Germany. Creuzer,<a name="FNanchor_1522" id="FNanchor_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> indeed,
holding that the myths of the ancients must embody their best
thought, and falling back on symbolism, cannot be said to have
advanced his subject except by his collection of materials; there
is some basis for his position if the ancient myths are taken in the
sense given them by the later poets and philosophers, but the supposition
of a primary symbolism in myths is set aside by an
examination of the ideas of undeveloped races. Creuzer's theory
was effectively combated by Voss.<a name="FNanchor_1523" id="FNanchor_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> Other writers of the time
adopted exacter methods of inquiry,<a name="FNanchor_1524" id="FNanchor_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> and K. O. M&uuml;ller,<a name="FNanchor_1525" id="FNanchor_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> particularly,
laid the foundation for a scientific treatment of myths by
distinguishing between their real and their ideal elements, between
the actual phenomenon and the imaginative (the true mythical)
explanation of it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_876" id="p_876">876</a></b>. The next generation witnessed two retrograde movements
in the interpretation of myths. F. Max M&uuml;ller, dazzled by the
wealth of Sanskrit mythological material, revived the solar theory,
with a peculiar appendage;<a name="FNanchor_1526" id="FNanchor_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> the defects of his theory must not
blind us to the great service he performed in arousing interest in
the comparative study of myths and leading the way to a formulation
of the conception of the general history of religion. On
another side the vast accumulation of the religious ideas and usages
of lower tribes led Herbert Spencer to his euhemeristic view.<a name="FNanchor_1527" id="FNanchor_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a>
Neither of these theories has seriously affected the growth of the
science of mythology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span><b><a name="p_877" id="p_877">877</a></b>. A saner direction was given to investigation by the great
biological and sociological studies made in the second half of the
nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1528" id="FNanchor_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> E. B. Tylor definitely stated the view that
the origin of myths is to be found in all the ideas of early man.
By a very large collection of facts<a name="FNanchor_1529" id="FNanchor_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a> he showed that the same representations
that are familiar in Egyptian, Semitic, Hindu, Greek,
Roman, and other ancient myths occur also in the systems of half-civilized
and savage communities; and he pointed out how such
representations had their basis in the simple ideas of undeveloped
men and how their survival is to be traced through all periods of
history. This fruitful view has been illustrated and developed by
later writers,<a name="FNanchor_1530" id="FNanchor_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> and much light has been thrown on the genesis and
growth of myths by studies of existing popular customs in civilized
communities.<a name="FNanchor_1531" id="FNanchor_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_878" id="p_878">878</a></b>. Interest in the subject has now become general, and collections
of material are being made all over the world.<a name="FNanchor_1532" id="FNanchor_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> At the same
time it is recognized that every local mass of myths must be studied
first by itself and then in connection with all other known material,
and that great caution must be exercised in dealing with questions
of origin, transmission, and survival. Arch&aelig;ological and geographical
discoveries have widened the known area of human life on
earth; it is seen that the history of man's development is more
complicated than was formerly supposed.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_879" id="p_879">879</a></b>. We are still without a general survey of myths arranged
in some orderly fashion.<a name="FNanchor_1533" id="FNanchor_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> The material for such a collection is
scattered through a great number of publications, in which the
mythical stories are not always treated critically. The most useful
principle of tabulation, perhaps, would be an arrangement according
to motifs, under which geographical or ethnological and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>geographical relations might be noted. At the present time it would
be possible only to make a beginning in such a work, since the
obtainable material is not all recorded, and the complicated character
of many myths makes an arrangement by place and motif
difficult. Still, even an incomplete digest would be of service to
students of mythology and would pave the way for a more comprehensive
work. The importance of the study of mythology for
the general history of religions is becoming more and more manifest.
This study, in its full form, includes, of course, psychological
investigation as well as collections of statistics; but the psychology
finds its material in the facts&mdash;we must first know what men
believe, and then explain why they believe.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_880" id="p_880">880</a></b>. It must, however, be added that myths have influenced
mainly the dogmas and ceremonies of religion&mdash;their part in more
intimate or spiritual worship, the converse of the worshiper with
the deity, has been comparatively slight. Religious ceremonies are
ordinary social customs and forms transferred to dealings with
supernatural Powers. Dogmas are quasi-philosophical expressions
of conceptions concerning the nature of these Powers and their
relations with men, and sometimes contain mythical material which
is then introduced into worship; if, for example, a man is divinized
and worship is paid him, the tone of the worship is affected by the
divine character thus ascribed to him. But in general, as men, in
worship proper, approach a deity to get some advantage from him,
the appeal is to him directly without regard to ceremonies or
minute dogmas. Savages, though in theory they may make a god
to be an animal or a plant, come to him devoutly as a superior
being who can grant their requests. In higher religions the deity
addressed is for the moment an omnipotent friend standing apart
from the stories told of him. Rival sects lose sight of their differences
in the presence of needs that drive them to God for help.
Prayer is a religious unifier&mdash;communion with the Deity is an individual
experience in which all men stand on common ground,
where ritual and dogmatic accessories tend to fade or to disappear.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_881" id="p_881">881</a></b>. Long after myths in their original forms have ceased to
be believed they persist in the form of "fairy tales," which retain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
something of the old supernatural framework, but sink into mere
stories for amusement.<a name="FNanchor_1534" id="FNanchor_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a></p>

<p>But fairy tales are not the only form in which ancient myths
persist. Myths have played their prominent part in the history of
religion for the reason that they embody the conception of the
tangible supernatural in a vivid and dramatic way. To this personalization
and socialization of the supernatural men have continued
to cling up to the present time; the mass of men demand
not only the presence of the supernatural as protection and guidance,
but also the realization of it in objective form. This objectiveness
was useful and necessary in early times, and the demand
for it remains in periods of advanced civilization. In the reigning
religions of the world at the present day myths continue to hold
their place and to exercise their influence,<a name="FNanchor_1535" id="FNanchor_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> the more that in the
course of time they become fused with the constantly advancing
ethical and spiritual thought of the communities in which they
exist. The tendency appears to be to minimize, under the influence
of general enlightenment, the crude supernatural parts of such
combinations, to exalt the moral and spiritual, and to allegorize or
rationalize the rest. But along with such process of rationalization
the mythical form is maintained and continues to be a powerful
element in the general structure of religious opinion and life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>MAGIC AND DIVINATION</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_882" id="p_882">882</a></b>. The regulation of relations with the superhuman world
has been attempted by means of friendly social intercourse with
supernatural Powers, and by studying their methods of procedure
with a view to applying these methods and thereby gaining beneficial
results. Friendly social intercourse is practical religion in the
higher sense of that term. The application and use of superhuman
procedures takes two lines of action: the powers of superhuman
agents may be appropriated and used independently of them, or
the object may be simply to discover their will in order to be
guided by it. The first of these lines is magic, the second is
divination. While the two have in common the frank and independent
employment of the supernatural for the bettering of
human life, their conceptions and modes of procedure differ in
certain respects, and they may be considered separately.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Magic</span><a name="FNanchor_1536" id="FNanchor_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_883" id="p_883">883</a></b>. The perils and problems of savage life, more acute in
certain directions than those that confront the civilized man, demand
constant vigilance, careful investigation, and prompt action.
So far as familiar and tangible enemies (beasts and men) are concerned,
common sense has devised methods of defense, and ordinary
prudence has suggested means of providing against excessive
heat or cold and of procuring food. But there are dangers and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>ills that in the savage view cannot be referred to such sources,
but must be held to be caused by intangible, invisible forces in
the world, against which it is man's business to guard himself.
He must learn what they are and how to thwart or use them as
circumstances may require. They could be studied only in their
deeds, and this study involves man in the investigation of the law
of cause and effect. The only visible bond between phenomena is
that of sequence, and on sequence the savage bases his science
of causes&mdash;that which precedes is cause, that which follows is
effect. The agencies he recognizes are spirits, gods, the force
resident in things (mana), and human beings who are able to use
this force.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_884" id="p_884">884</a></b>. But belief in such agencies would be useless to man unless
he also believed that he could somehow determine their actions,
and belief in the possibility of determining these appears to have
come to him through his theory of natural law. The reasoning of
savages on this point has not been recorded by them, but the
character of their known procedures leads us to suppose that they
have a sense of a law governing the actions of superhuman
Powers. Being conscious that they themselves are governed by
law, they may naturally in imagination transfer this order of things
to the whole invisible world; spirits, gods, and the mana-power,
it is assumed, work on lines similar to those followed by man, only
with superhuman breadth and force. The task before the originators
of society was to discover these modes of procedure in
order to act in accordance with them. The discovery was made
gradually by observation, and there grew up thus in process of
time a science of supernatural procedure which is the basis of the
practice of magic.</p>

<p>This science does not necessarily regard the superhuman power
as purposely antagonistic to man. Rather its native attitude appears
to have been conceived of as one of indifference (as nature
is now regarded as careless of man); it was and is thought of as a
force to be guarded against and utilized by available means, which,
of course, were and are such as are proper to an undeveloped
stage of social growth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span></p>

<p><b><a name="p_885" id="p_885">885</a></b>. Magic is a science of sequences, but only of sequences
supposed not to be explicable from ordinary experience. When
the savage puts his hand into the fire or receives a spear-thrust
in his body he recognizes visible and familiar causes of pain, and
accepts the situation as a fact of life, calling for no further explanation.
But when the pain comes from no familiar tangible
source he is driven to seek a different sort of source. A cause
there must be, and this cause, though superhuman, must follow
definite methods&mdash;it must have the will to act, and it must have
knowledge and skill to carry out its designs. To discover its
methods man must observe the processes of nature and imitate
them, and must at the same time have in mind familiar human
modes of action. The savage scientific explanation of mysterious
facts is that superhuman Powers are intellectually akin to human
beings; the question of motive in such Powers (except in the case
of developed gods) seems not to be considered. The basis of
magical procedure is imitation of nature and of man. This principle
is supplemented by the conception of the unity of the world,
a feeling at first vague, that all things have the same nature and
are bound together in a cosmos; animals and men, trees, stones
and waters, and fragments of all these are parts of one great
whole, and each feels, so to speak, what is done to or by one of
the others. This feeling, derived from observation and reflection,
is not formulated, but is influential in the construction of the
unconscious philosophy of the savage.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_886" id="p_886">886</a></b>. The methods of man's magical procedure follow these
principles; they are as various as the sequences that savage man
thinks he observes.<a name="FNanchor_1537" id="FNanchor_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> Many of them are suggested by natural
phenomena. Since rain was observed to fall from the sky, it was
held that in time of drought it might be obtained by casting water
into the air and letting it fall, or by dipping a stone in water and
letting it drip; in general, by any process in which water falls on
the ground. The wind might be raised by ejecting air from the
mouth (as by whistling). Or ordinary human actions might be
imitated: a stick thrown or pointed toward an enemy, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>believed, would cause a spear to enter his body;<a name="FNanchor_1538" id="FNanchor_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> a hostile glance
of the eye, indicating desire to inflict injury, might carry ill luck.<a name="FNanchor_1539" id="FNanchor_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a>
In such cases the fundamental conceptions are the sympathy that
comes from unity and the activity of the pervasive mana. These
conceptions are visible in procedures in which action on a part of
the human body, or on an image or picture of it, was supposed to
reach the body itself. The possession of a piece of the bone, skin,
hair, or nail of a man might enable one who had knowledge of
superhuman laws and processes to affect the man with sickness
or even to cause his death. Contact of objects naturally suggests
their unity, but the sympathy between them was not held to be
dependent on contact; a man's bone remained a part of him,
however far it might be separated from him. A dead body did
not lose its virtues; the qualities of a dead warrior might be
acquired by eating his flesh. The mysterious unity of things
seems to have resided, in savage thought, in the omnipresent
mana, a force independent of human limitations. Not that there
was a definite theory on the subject, but something of this sort
seems to be assumed in the ideas and usages of many low tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1540" id="FNanchor_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, a magical effect may be set aside by magic.
A sick man, believing his sickness to be the work of a magician
(the usual savage theory of the cause of bodily ills), sends for
another magician to counteract the evil work; and a magician,
failing to cure his patient, ascribes his failure to the machinations
of a powerful rival. In all such cases the theory and the methods
are the same; the magic that cures is not different in principle
(though it may differ in details) from the magic that kills.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_887" id="p_887">887</a></b>. The facts observed by practicers of magic probably contributed
to the collections of material that furnished the starting-point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>for the scientific study of physical phenomena. The interest in the
facts arose at first simply from their relation to magical procedure&mdash;it
was from them that certain laws of supernatural action were
learned, and men thus got control of this action. Magic is essentially
a directive or coercive procedure and differs in this respect
from fully formed religion, which is essentially submissive and
obedient.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_888" id="p_888">888</a></b>. It is true that coercion of divine beings appears in well-developed
religions. A Babylonian goddess (Nana) was carried off
by the Elamites to their land that she might there do duty as divine
protector; restored to her proper home 1635 years later, she resumed
her old functions.<a name="FNanchor_1541" id="FNanchor_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> The Egyptians are said by Plutarch to
have slain their divine animals if these failed to avert or remove
calamity.<a name="FNanchor_1542" id="FNanchor_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a> Prometheus and certain Homeric heroes are victorious
over gods. In some savage tribes divine kings are put to death if
they fail to do what is expected of them. A god was sometimes
chained or confined in his temple to prevent his voluntary or constrained
departure. A recusant deity was sometimes taunted or
insulted by his disappointed worshipers.<a name="FNanchor_1543" id="FNanchor_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a> There is, however, a difference
between the two sets of coercive acts. The force used by
developed religion is physical, that employed in magic is psychological
and logical. When a god is chained or carried off, it is only
his body that is controlled&mdash;he is left to his own thoughts, or it is
assumed that he will be friendly to his enforced locus. Magic brings
the supernatural Power under the dominion of law against which
his nature is powerless. Religion, even when it employs force, recognizes
the protective function of the deity; magic is without such
acknowledgment, without emotion or worship. While it has, on
one side, a profounder conception of cosmic force than appears in
early religion, it is, on the social side, vastly inferior to the latter,
to which it has necessarily yielded in the course of human progress.
Nevertheless, if religion in the broadest sense includes all means
of bringing man into helpful relations with the supernatural world,
then magic is a form of religion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span><b><a name="p_889" id="p_889">889</a></b>. The much-discussed question whether magic was the earliest
form of religion is not susceptible of a definite answer for the reason
that we have no account of man's earliest conceptions of his relations
with the world of invisible forces. There is some reason to
hold, as is remarked above,<a name="FNanchor_1544" id="FNanchor_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a> that in the lowest stage of life known
to us men were logically indifferent spectators of the world, but in
general stood in awe of phenomena, so that fear was their prevailing
feeling. It may be surmised that this feeling would engender a
sense of antagonism to such superhuman Powers as came to be
conceived of, on which would naturally follow a desire to get control
of them. Yet it is impossible to say at what stage of social
development the necessity would be felt of establishing friendly
relations with the Powers. The two lines of effort may have begun
and gone on side by side, the two springing from the same utilitarian
impulse, but each independent of the other&mdash;a coexistence that
actually appears in many tribes; finally the coercive effort tends
to yield to the kindly influences of organized society. There is no
ground for calling magic a "disease of religion." The presumption,
from the general law of progress, is that, when there is a chronological
difference, the socially lower precedes the socially higher.
Religion and magic come to be mutually antagonistic, except in
cases where religious authorities adopt magical procedures, giving
them a theistic and socially useful coloring. Magic has been a natural,
if not a necessary, step in the religious organization of society.<a name="FNanchor_1545" id="FNanchor_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_890" id="p_890">890</a></b>. Since religion and magic have in common the purpose to
establish relations with extrahuman Powers the dividing line between
the two is in some cases not easily fixed&mdash;the same procedure
may be held to belong in the one category or the other,
according as it invokes or does not invoke the aid of a god in
friendly and submissive fashion. We may thus be carried back to
a time when a sharp distinction between the two did not exist, as
there was a time when such a distinction is not visible between
"gods" (friendly divine members of the human community) and
"demons" (unfriendly outside beings), both classes being regarded
simply as agents affecting human life. Even when some fairly good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>form of organization has been reached it is often hard to say to
which class a particular figure belongs. The Hawaiian Pele (the
"goddess" of the great and dangerous volcano) is often vindictive,
and then differs little or not at all from a demon that sends sickness
and death.<a name="FNanchor_1546" id="FNanchor_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> The Babylonians gave the same name (<i>shedu</i>) to a
class of demons proper and to the divine or half-divine winged
beings (to which, apparently, the Hebrew cherubs are allied) that
guarded the entrances to temples, sacred gardens, and palaces.<a name="FNanchor_1547" id="FNanchor_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a>
The Navaho beings called <i>yei</i> and <i>anaye</i> seem to hover on the
border line between the divine and the demonic classes.<a name="FNanchor_1548" id="FNanchor_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a> The difference
between the two seems to be merely that the one class
(the gods) has been adopted (for reasons not originally ethical)
into the human community, while the other has not received such
adoption.<a name="FNanchor_1549" id="FNanchor_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> In such a case a given figure may easily pass from one
class into the other. According to the Thompson River folk-lore
the sun was once a cannibal but became beneficent.<a name="FNanchor_1550" id="FNanchor_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a> The early
Christians converted the Gr&aelig;co-Roman gods (<i>daimonia</i>) into
"demons."<a name="FNanchor_1551" id="FNanchor_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a> There being this fluid relation between supernatural
beings, it is not strange that such a relation should exist between
procedures intended to act on them.<a name="FNanchor_1552" id="FNanchor_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_891" id="p_891">891</a></b>. Magic, as we have seen, is based on the observation of
sequences, and before the development of reflection and the acquisition
of a knowledge of natural law the disposition of human beings
is to regard all sequences as exhibiting the relation of cause and
effect. A typical example is that of the anchor driven ashore, a
piece of which was broken off by a man who died soon after; the
conclusion was that the anchor caused his death and therefore was
divine, and accordingly it received religious worship.<a name="FNanchor_1553" id="FNanchor_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> In the course
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>of ages thousands of such sequences must have been observed,
and these, handed down from one generation to another, would
shape themselves into a handbook of magic. They would, however,
be constantly re&euml;xamined and sifted under the guidance of wider
experience and a better acquaintance with natural causes, and this
process, carried on by experts, would give rise to the science of
magic as we find it among lower tribes.</p>

<p>Magic, like religion, is a social product. The two, as is remarked
above, may coexist in the same community. But when a State religion
is established to which all citizens are expected to conform,
the pursuit of magic assumes the aspect of departure from, and
hostility to, the tribal or national cult. It is then under the ban,
and can be carried on only in secret<a name="FNanchor_1554" id="FNanchor_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> (as is the case with prohibited
religions also). Secrecy of practice is not of the essence of magic;
among the Australian Arunta, for example, magical ceremonies
constitute the publicly recognized business of the community acting
through its accredited representatives; the partial exclusion of
women and uninitiated boys from these ceremonies (and from
political councils) is due mainly to the desire of the elders to keep
the power in their own hands. The State religion may sometimes
be forced by public opinion to adopt particular magical procedures.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_892" id="p_892">892</a></b>. It was natural that the specific study of sequences and
laws should fall into the hands of special persons and classes of
men. The human agent in the discovery of laws is the magician
(sorcerer, shaman), who, since he was generally a physician also,
sometimes received the name of "medicine man." As the office
of chief arose for the direction of social culture and political affairs,
so the office of magician arose naturally for the direction of supernatural
relations. He may have been the earliest religious teacher
and guide.<a name="FNanchor_1555" id="FNanchor_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a> He knows the will and nature of the supernatural
Powers and is therefore a necessity to men. He is specifically in
charge of all that relates to the control of these Powers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span><b><a name="p_893" id="p_893">893</a></b>. In the course of time there arises a differentiation of functions,
and, when religion becomes friendly, the office of priest is
created. The priest, like the magician, understands the will of the
gods, but his procedure is intended simply to propitiate them or to
discover their will in particular cases.<a name="FNanchor_1556" id="FNanchor_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> He is a development out
of the magician in so far as friendly religion is a development out of
magical religion.<a name="FNanchor_1557" id="FNanchor_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> The prophet also, in the r&ocirc;le in which he appears
among the Greeks, is a development out of the old magician; he
knows the will of the gods and is thus able to predict events. This
is the character of the old Hebrew seer; the Hebrew prophet,
originally a seer, assumed in the course of time a quite different
character&mdash;he became a preacher of ethical religion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_894" id="p_894">894</a></b>. The office of magician, once established, became subject
to all the rules that govern official persons in barbarous, half-civilized,
and civilized societies. Of the way in which the position
was attained in the earliest times we have no information, but in
relatively low tribes it appears that it is attained in various ways.
There is sometimes a suggestion of vocation in a dream or a
vision.<a name="FNanchor_1558" id="FNanchor_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a> Among some tribes a candidate for the office has to
undergo a process of education, that is, of training in the signs
by which the presence of superhuman Powers is recognizable and
of the way of dealing with disease and other evils.<a name="FNanchor_1559" id="FNanchor_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> It is not unusual
that the candidate is required to submit to a test, sometimes
of physical endurance (as is required also in the case of the
young warrior), but chiefly of susceptibility to supernatural influences
and capacity of insight, and of the conduct of magical operations.<a name="FNanchor_1560" id="FNanchor_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a>
Generally in the lower tribes the office comes by free
choice of the individual, or by choice of the body of magicians,
without regard to the social position of the man. In West Africa,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>says Miss Kingsley, everybody keeps a familiar spirit or two
for magical purposes; this is unlawful only when the spirit is
harmful.<a name="FNanchor_1561" id="FNanchor_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_895" id="p_895">895</a></b>. In somewhat more advanced societies the office falls into
the hands of families and descends from father to son, in which
case the younger man is instructed by the older in the secrets of
the profession.<a name="FNanchor_1562" id="FNanchor_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a> In some higher religions magical performances
are in the hands of certain clans or tribes. In most of these cases
women as well as men may be masters of the art. In the more
advanced systems it is often the case that it is especially women
who are considered adepts; so it was in Babylonia;<a name="FNanchor_1563" id="FNanchor_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a> in the Old
Testament Saul seeks the woman of Endor;<a name="FNanchor_1564" id="FNanchor_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a> Thessalian witches
were famous;<a name="FNanchor_1565" id="FNanchor_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> women who tie magical knots are provided against
in the Koran by a special form of prayer;<a name="FNanchor_1566" id="FNanchor_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a> in Europe, medieval
and later, the practicers of magic have generally been women.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_896" id="p_896">896</a></b>. The grounds for the ascription of magical superiority to
women&mdash;whether from their supposed greater susceptibility to
demoniac influence, or for some other reason&mdash;are not clear.
In the lowest tribes sorcerers are commonly men<a name="FNanchor_1567" id="FNanchor_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a>&mdash;the profession
is an influential and honored one, and naturally falls into the
hands of leading men; the magician is often the most powerful
man in the community.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_897" id="p_897">897</a></b>. Reputation for magical power appears sometimes to attach
to a tribe or other body of persons as the representatives of a
religion which is adopted by a lower community. Possibly this
is the explanation of the r&ocirc;le ascribed at an early period to the
Mazdean Magi.<a name="FNanchor_1568" id="FNanchor_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a> The Magi (apparently Median of origin) formed
the priestly tribe of the Mazdean religion, and we do not know
that they played originally any part as sorcerers. But it seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>that they were so considered in Greece as early as the fifth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_1569" id="FNanchor_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a> and after the Moslem conquest of Persia and the
suppression of Zoroastrianism a fire-worshiper or Magian is especially
a representative of magic.<a name="FNanchor_1570" id="FNanchor_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a> On the other hand, it sometimes
happens among adjoining tribes that the lower become the
special practitioners of magic,<a name="FNanchor_1571" id="FNanchor_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> which is then considered to be a
mysterious art, alien to the official religion, and therefore proper
to the ministers of the old mysterious cults.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_898" id="p_898">898</a></b>. The power exercised by the magician extends over the
whole world of men and things, and is generally considered to
be practically without limit. He guards men against diseases,
noxious beasts, and all other forms of injury; he destroys one's
enemies and guards one against plots of enemies, including other
magicians; he is able to induce or destroy love, to give physical
strength, to inflict disease, to kill, and to restore to life; he ascends
to heaven or descends into the world below; he is able to coerce
the gods themselves; in fact, he does everything that a god is
commonly supposed to do&mdash;the tendency was to identify the
magician and the god.<a name="FNanchor_1572" id="FNanchor_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a> Such identification is natural or necessary
in early faiths, inasmuch as it was held that there was no difference
of nature between men and gods. A god was as a rule the
stronger. But how gods arose and how they gained their superior
strength was not clear, and it might thus easily happen that a
man should acquire powers equal to those of divine beings.<a name="FNanchor_1573" id="FNanchor_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span><b><a name="p_899" id="p_899">899</a></b>. The methods employed by the magician to effect his purpose
are various. In early times it is usual for him to fall into
an ecstatic state; by drinking intoxicating liquors, by violent movements,
or by contemplation he gets out of himself and comes into
relations with the mysterious potencies. In such a condition he
acts as his imagination suggests.<a name="FNanchor_1574" id="FNanchor_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a> But in the organized forms of
magic long experience has devised various means of producing
results beyond the power of ordinary men. Certain objects are
magically charged with supernatural power (charms), and these
worn on the person guard the possessor against malign influences.
Various formulas are employed which are supposed to coerce the
Powers; these are sometimes names of ordinary objects regarded
as sacred, the name of some plant or animal.<a name="FNanchor_1575" id="FNanchor_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a> Names of divine
persons have special potency. The name of a god was supposed
to carry with it his power, and the utterance of his name secured
all that he could secure; thus, in the early Christian times the tetragrammaton
YHWH (Yahweh) had absolute power against demons.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_900" id="p_900">900</a></b>. Similar efficacy attached to sacred compositions, prayers,<a name="FNanchor_1576" id="FNanchor_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a>
and the like. The Mazdean petition, Honover (Ahuna-Vairya),
was so employed, and in Christian circles even the Lord's Prayer.
Charms or incantations often took rhythmical form&mdash;verses,
couplets, or quatrains were widely used. All such methods were
the product of ages of experience.<a name="FNanchor_1577" id="FNanchor_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> They were handed down from
generation to generation, often in families or classes of magicians,
were modified or enlarged from time to time, and thus came at
last to form a literature.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_901" id="p_901">901</a></b>. In the great civilized religions magical practice gradually
assumed a tone somewhat different from that of the earliest times.
It continued to be coercive toward evil Powers, but in regard to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>the good Powers it assumed rather to discover their modes of
action. It was not anti-religious; it remained alongside of the
official religious systems in friendly relations. It relied on the
assistance of the good gods and not on that of the demons. There
was good magic and bad magic, white magic and black magic, as
these came to be called. A procedure of white magic can thus,
from the point of view of religion, hardly be distinguished from
prayer to a deity. The difference between the two appears to be
that the magic produces abnormal or violent effects, which experience
taught could not reasonably be expected from the deity. It
is the old crude science brought (as the lesser divine Powers were
brought) into a relation of subordination to the chief god of the
community.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_902" id="p_902">902</a></b>. Elaborate magical systems are found in some of the ancient
national religions. In India the Atharva-Veda, though it contains
a mass of crude old material, is nevertheless recognized as one of
the sacred books, standing by the side of the Rig-Veda, though of
less authority and significance than that. The Atharvan was originally
a priest of fire, but in this work he becomes simply a magician;
the immense number of magical procedures in the book provided
for all emergencies of life.<a name="FNanchor_1578" id="FNanchor_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a> The Babylonian magical formulas also
go back to an early time, but they were preserved by the priests
and recognized as a legitimate element in the religious practice.<a name="FNanchor_1579" id="FNanchor_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a>
The old Egyptian stories introduce a number of magical proceedings,
and the formulas have been preserved in treatises.<a name="FNanchor_1580" id="FNanchor_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> Of the
earliest periods of the Mazdean religion we have unfortunately
no records; in the time of the decadence of the national religion,
especially in the Thousand and One Nights, the fire-worshiper or
Magian is commonly a wicked magician, as was natural since he
belonged to a faith hostile to Islam, and the practicer of good magic
is generally a Moslem.<a name="FNanchor_1581" id="FNanchor_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a> The early Greeks and Romans appear not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>to have been greatly interested in magical practices, though these
existed.<a name="FNanchor_1582" id="FNanchor_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a> But a great outburst of magic occurred in the Gr&aelig;co-Roman
world in the first and second centuries of our era, the
magician being, however, generally not Greek or Roman, but of
an inferior alien race.<a name="FNanchor_1583" id="FNanchor_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> Among the old Hebrews we have no details
of magical procedure except in the invocation of the dead;<a name="FNanchor_1584" id="FNanchor_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a>
this procedure was denounced by the prophets as hostile to the
worship of the national god, but it continued among the people a
long time.<a name="FNanchor_1585" id="FNanchor_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> The practice of magic existed abundantly among the
early peoples of Europe, the Teutons, and others. The primacy,
however, in magic belongs to the Finns and Lapps, alien races
regarded as inferior in civilization.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_903" id="p_903">903</a></b>. The hold of magic on the minds of men is shown by the
fact that it has persisted up to the present day. Its basis is a belief
in occult powers and the conviction that man may attain to mastery
over them. Certain forms of this belief, called theosophical, are
held by many at the present day; it is supposed that men are
capable of transcending the ordinary limitations of humanity. In
general, however, the whole system of magic yielded gradually to
the organized religions, the essence of which was a friendly and
rational relation with the deity. Religion has organized itself in
accord with the general organization of human social systems. It
has seen the necessity of getting rid of force, of depending on
humane feeling, cultivating simply friendly relations, attempting
a unity of work, a co&ouml;peration of divine and human forces. All
this has worked against magic. In addition to these tendencies
the constantly growing belief in the domination of natural forces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>has made it impossible in civilized societies to accept the powers
called magical.<a name="FNanchor_1586" id="FNanchor_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_904" id="p_904">904</a></b>. To sum up: magic is a means of securing superhuman
results by adopting the methods of the superhuman Powers.<a name="FNanchor_1587" id="FNanchor_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> It
may be coeval with religion proper or may have preceded it in
human religious organization. In any case it has been, up to the
present day, the rival of religion, though more and more driven
to take a secondary place. It has collected physical facts which
have served as a basis for the study of physical science and have
indirectly furthered the cause of religion by leading men to recognize
natural law and also by necessitating a distinction between
theistic and other superhuman results.<a name="FNanchor_1588" id="FNanchor_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a> In the absence of distinct
religious systems it has been a bond of social union, and to that
extent has been a civilizing influence. On the other hand, it has
fostered belief in a false science of sequences and thus helped to
introduce confusion into thought and the conduct of life. The aim
of religion has been, and is, to banish magic from the world.<a name="FNanchor_1589" id="FNanchor_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Divination</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_905" id="p_905">905</a></b>. Divination is the science that seeks to discover the will of
the supernatural Powers by means of the observation of phenomena.
Men desire to learn the causes of present and past misfortunes
and the story of the future, that they may know at any moment
what is the best course to pursue. The underlying supposition is
that these things are indicated by the appearances and movements
of the various objects of the world. It is in these phenomena that
the purposes of superhuman forces become visible to man; the
gods, it is held, cannot but so reveal themselves (for they produce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>all phenomena), and man's task is to discover the laws of phenomenal
revelation. The question of the motive in this revelation
is not distinctly raised, but it is taken for granted that the Powers
are willing to help man by guiding his uncertain footsteps; their
attitude is so far friendly&mdash;they belong in feeling to the human
community.<a name="FNanchor_1590" id="FNanchor_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a></p>

<p>Divination has in common with magic the assumption of the
unity of the world and its control by law, and the search for divine
activity in the facts of life. But the two differ essentially in their
aims. Divination seeks to learn the divine will in order to be guided;
magic studies divine action in order to imitate it and accomplish
divine results. Divination is an inquirer, and its virtue is obedience;
magic is an investigator, and its virtue is achievement. Both are
self-seeking, but divination is the more reverent and allies itself
more easily with religion. But both tend to become corrupt and
decadent, and their r&ocirc;les are determined from time to time by the
conditions of the communities in which they are found.<a name="FNanchor_1591" id="FNanchor_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_906" id="p_906">906</a></b>. The organization of divination resembles that of magic in
several respects. It comes to have its special functionaries, into
whose hands all its authority falls. The divinatory power (like the
magical) comes to a man sometimes as a gift of nature (that is, of
a god) or in some mysterious external way, sometimes as a result
of a course of training in which the significance of the various signs
is learned. It is sometimes a property of a clan or a family and
descends from father to son, always, however, under the condition
of instruction of the young by the old. The diviner, like the magician,
sometimes performs various ceremonies for the purpose of
bringing himself into relation with the gods, and his utterances are
frequently given in an ecstatic condition. In this condition he is
said in some instances (as among the Todas<a name="FNanchor_1592" id="FNanchor_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a>) to speak a language
not his own, with which in his ordinary state of mind he is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>unacquainted, or to utter words that are not understood either by
himself or by others. Ecstasy means possession by the deity;
the interpretation of the diviner's words, which, in the ecstatic condition,
are the words of a spirit or a god, is sometimes left to the
bystanders, or, if unintelligible to them, must be recovered by the
seer himself when he returns to his normal condition.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_907" id="p_907">907</a></b>. The highest development of ecstasy is found in the prophet
proper. Originally the prophet was a foreteller and acted under
the inspiration of a god, a divine seizure that was allied to madness.
The ravings of the savage shaman<a name="FNanchor_1593" id="FNanchor_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> are repeated in the ravings of
Cassandra and in the excited utterances and bodily exhaustion of
the early Hebrew prophets.<a name="FNanchor_1594" id="FNanchor_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> A nobler use of ecstasy is exhibited
in the youth of Byblos, who rescued an unfortunate Egyptian envoy
from insult and secured him honorable treatment.<a name="FNanchor_1595" id="FNanchor_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> The more advanced
thought tended to abandon the abnormal state of the diviner
and make him simply a recipient of divine knowledge by the favor
of a god&mdash;the gods came to choose thoughtful men instead of
beasts as their intermediaries.<a name="FNanchor_1596" id="FNanchor_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a> The Hebrew prophets whose utterances
have been preserved, from Amos onward, are men of insight,
essentially critics of the national life, and moral watchmen; but
features of the old conception of divinatory power continue for
some time to attach to them.<a name="FNanchor_1597" id="FNanchor_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_908" id="p_908">908</a></b>. The differentiation of functions between magician, diviner,
and priest appears to have taken place at a comparatively early
period, though it is probable that in the earliest times all these
characters might be united in a single person. As soon as an
organized religion is established the priest acquires his specific
function as intermediator between men and gods, often, however,
retaining the power of discovering the will of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_1598" id="FNanchor_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> Magic,
as we have seen, tends to become an unsocial and hostile thing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>and the magician is in later times punished or discountenanced by
public opinion. The diviner, on the other hand, has generally retained
possession of his public for the reason that he is in sympathy
with the gods of the community and his work is held to be wholly
friendly. In all stages of religious development, except the very
highest, he has been recognized by public opinion and by law as a
part of the religious constitution of society and has often attained
great civil and political power.<a name="FNanchor_1599" id="FNanchor_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a> Among civilized peoples he comes
to be a man of learning, acquainted with many things besides the
mere signs of the will of the gods.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_909" id="p_909">909</a></b>. Divinatory signs may be grouped in various classes according
as they belong to the outer world or to men's inward experiences,
and according as they present themselves without or with
preparation by man. Outward signs in ordinary occurrences which,
so far as human initiative is concerned, are accidental may be
called, for convenience, "omens." Uncommon occurrences may be
called, if they appear in the forms of men and animals, "prodigies,"
and if they are seen in the physical world, "portents." These designations
are arbitrary, and sometimes two or more of them may be
appropriate for the same event. Inward signs are dreams, revelations
in the ecstatic state, and prophetic inspirations.<a name="FNanchor_1600" id="FNanchor_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a> We may
begin with divination from the observation of external objects, and
consider first such as are accidental (omens, prodigies, portents).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_910" id="p_910">910</a></b>. Omens, prodigies, and portents are to be regarded as the
product of ages of experience. The observations of early men
seem to them to show that certain appearances are followed by
certain events, and the details of experience, handed down and
interpreted by successive generations, are in the course of time
sifted, systematized, and formulated. In savage and half-civilized
communities divinatory signs are usually simple, drawn from appearances
of familiar objects and occurrences. They become more
complicated in civilized times&mdash;they are mingled with elaborate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>astrological ideas. Divination becomes a science for the practice
of which a technical education is required. Belief in omens and
other signs survives among the highest civilized peoples long after
the conceptions on which they rest have been abandoned. The
origin of signs among savage peoples may often be traced with
more or less probability; in the case of such as survive in periods
of high culture the origin is necessarily obscured by the lapse
of time and can be surmised only by comparison with earlier
conceptions.</p>

<p>The belief in such signs may be traced over a great part of the
world. It is found among the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians,
Assyrians, Hindus, Chinese, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Arabians,
and at a later time among the Celtic, Slavic, and Teutonic peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1601" id="FNanchor_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a>
At the present day it occurs most highly developed in Polynesia,
Northern Africa, Southern India, and Central Asia; it is relatively
unimportant in Western and Central Africa, North America, South
America, and Australia. One difference between divination and
magic thus appears to be that the latter is vigorous in savage
communities that pay little attention to the former. Further collections
of facts may require a modification of this statement; but, in
general, it would seem that an organization of signs, demanding, as
it does, orderly reflection on phenomena, is proper to communities
that have advanced beyond the hunting and nomadic stages. For
the rest, there are few objects or occurrences that have not been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>regarded at some time by some people as indications of divine will
in respect to present, past, or future events.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_911" id="p_911">911</a></b>. A fair illustration of the early belief in omens is afforded
by the divinatory system that prevails in Samoa and the neighboring
group of islands.<a name="FNanchor_1602" id="FNanchor_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a> It appears that all omens are derived either
from the movements of animals that are regarded as incarnations
of deities,<a name="FNanchor_1603" id="FNanchor_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> or from phenomena that are held to be produced immediately
by deities. The flight of owls, bats, or rails, according to
its direction, indicates the result of a battle or a war; the howling
of a dog is a sign of coming misfortune; if a centipede crawls on
the top of a mat it is a good omen, if on the bottom of a mat it is
bad; it is unfortunate when a lizard crosses one's path; if a basket
be found turned upside down in a road, this is a sign of evil; the
way in which sacred stones fall to the ground is an indication of
the future. The animals mentioned above (and there are many
other such) are all regarded as incarnations of deities. So as to
portents: loud thunder, taken to be the voice of the great god
Tangaloa, is a good sign; the significance of lightning (which also
is sent by the god) depends upon the direction taken by the flash.
An eclipse is regarded as a presage of death. A similar system of
interpretation of signs is found elsewhere. The Masai and the
Nandi draw omens from the movements of birds.<a name="FNanchor_1604" id="FNanchor_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> In Ashantiland
the cry of the owl means death.<a name="FNanchor_1605" id="FNanchor_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a> When in Australia the track of
an insect is believed to point toward the abode of the sorcerer by
whom a man has been done to death, the conception is probably
the same. The modern Afghans hold that a high wind that continues
three days is a sign that a murder has been committed.<a name="FNanchor_1606" id="FNanchor_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a>
Examples from Brazil, Borneo, New Zealand, Old Calabar and
Tatarland are given by Tylor.<a name="FNanchor_1607" id="FNanchor_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a> In the early Hebrew history
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>it appears that a rustling in trees was looked on as a sign of
divine intervention.<a name="FNanchor_1608" id="FNanchor_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_912" id="p_912">912</a></b>. In ancient Babylonia and Assyria an elaborate system of
interpretation of ordinary occurrences prevailed&mdash;the movements
and appearances of various species of birds, of bulls, of dogs of
all colors are noted, with minute interpretations.<a name="FNanchor_1609" id="FNanchor_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a> The Greeks
recognized omens in the acts of various animals, especially in the
flight and cries of birds; so important were these last that the
words for 'bird' came to be employed for 'omens from birds'
and even simply for 'omens';<a name="FNanchor_1610" id="FNanchor_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a> Aristophanes, laughing at the
Athenians, declares that they called every mantic sign 'bird'.<a name="FNanchor_1611" id="FNanchor_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a>
Skepticism, however, appears in Hector's passionate rejection of
the signs of birds and his declaration that the best omen is to fight
for one's country.<a name="FNanchor_1612" id="FNanchor_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a> A similar mantic prominence of birds appears
in ancient Rome where the terms for the observation of birds
(<i>auspicium</i>, <i>augurium</i>) came to signify 'omens' in general. The
pre&euml;minence thus accorded to birds was due perhaps to the fact
that they move in a region above the earth, the larger species
(&#959;&#7984;&#969;&#957;&#8057;&#962;) seeking the sky near the abode of the gods, as well as to
the frequency and variety of their actions.<a name="FNanchor_1613" id="FNanchor_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a> The feeling of direct
contact with the deity appears in the significance attached to the
movements of a sacrificial animal: if it approached the altar
willingly, this, showing accord with the deity, was a good omen,
and unwillingness was a bad omen.<a name="FNanchor_1614" id="FNanchor_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> Among the later Romans
the entrance of a strange black dog into a house, the falling of a
snake through the opening in the roof, the crowing of a hen were
unfavorable signs which prevented the immediate undertaking of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>any new affair;<a name="FNanchor_1615" id="FNanchor_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a> these were all unusual and therefore uncanny
occurrences. Some of the animals that furnish omens are totems,
and in such cases the totemic significance coalesces with that of
the omen; the animal that appears to the young Sioux candidate
as his manitu has both characters&mdash;it is the sign of divine acceptance
and the embodiment of the divine patron.<a name="FNanchor_1616" id="FNanchor_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_913" id="p_913">913</a></b>. Prodigies connected with the birth of children are numerous.
The complete or incomplete character of the infant's body,
various marks and colors, and the number produced at a birth
have been carefully noted by many peoples. The birth of twins
seems to have been more commonly regarded in savage and half-civilized
communities either as a presage of misfortune (as being
unusual and mysterious) or as a sign of conjugal unfaithfulness
(as indicating two fathers, one of whom might be a god). Interpretations
of births are given in Babylonian records.<a name="FNanchor_1617" id="FNanchor_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> Everywhere
monstrous births, misshapen forms, and abnormal colors in the

divine displeasure.</p>

shown by the fact that constellations are recognized in some
lower tribes&mdash;for example, in the New Hebrides Islands, among
the Todas, the Masai, the Nandi, and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1618" id="FNanchor_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> Since all
heavenly bodies were regarded originally as divine, and later as
controlled by divine beings, sometimes also as the abodes of the
dead or as the souls of the dead, it was natural that astral movements
should be looked on as giving signs of the will of the
gods. Astronomy appears to have been pursued in the first instance
not from interest in the natural laws governing the movements
of sun, moon, and stars, but from belief in their divinatory
significance. How far this study was carried on all over the
ancient world we have no means of knowing; but, as far as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>the records go, it was the Babylonians that first reduced astral
divination to the form of a science,<a name="FNanchor_1619" id="FNanchor_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> and it is probable that from
them it spread over Western Asia and India, and perhaps into
Europe. Babylonian and Assyrian documents contain many accurate
statements of the appearances of heavenly bodies; and
in the third or second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, as we learn from the Book
of Daniel, the term 'Chaldean' was synonymous with 'magician.'
While astronomy was pursued by the Egyptians with great success,
whereby they made a notable construction of the calendar,
they seem not to have cultivated astrology, though they associated
certain stars with certain gods and with lucky or unlucky days.<a name="FNanchor_1620" id="FNanchor_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_915" id="p_915">915</a></b>. Of all divinatory methods astrology has played the greatest
r&ocirc;le in human history, and is still believed in and studied by not
a few persons. It derived its prominence originally, no doubt,
from the splendor and mystery of the sidereal heavens; the
identification (by the Babylonians) of certain planets with certain
deities gave it more definite shape. It was necessarily a learned
pursuit, and, falling naturally into the hands of priestly bodies,
was developed by them in accordance with the needs of the situation.
Rules of interpretation were established that became more
and more specific. In the early period of astrology it was concerning
matters of public interest that information was sought&mdash;crops,
wars, and the fortunes of the king as the head of the
nation.<a name="FNanchor_1621" id="FNanchor_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> At a later time, but before the beginning of our era, in
accordance with the growth of ethical individualism, the stars
were interrogated for the destinies of private individuals;<a name="FNanchor_1622" id="FNanchor_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> the
aspect of the heavens at the moment of birth, the horoscope,
announced the fate of the nascent man.<a name="FNanchor_1623" id="FNanchor_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a></p>

<p>In the hands of the Chaldeans astrology remained exclusively or
largely a science of omens. An advance toward a higher conception,
however, was made by their identification of certain planets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>with certain gods,<a name="FNanchor_1624" id="FNanchor_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> whereby the regularity and certainty of movement
of the astral world were carried over to the world of divine
Powers. When, in the centuries just preceding and following the
beginning of our era, Chaldean astrology was adopted by the
Greeks and Romans, it was organized by them in accordance
with their philosophy, and it entered into alliance with all the
higher religious tendencies of the period. In the unchangeableness
of stellar movements the Stoics saw a principle substantially
identical with their doctrine of fate. Along various lines (in
Judaism and Christianity, and in the mysteries of Mithra and
Isis) men were moving toward the conception of a single supreme
ruler of the world, and astrology fell into line with this movement.
The starry universe was held to be the controller of human life,
worthy of worship, and able to call forth emotion. Thus astrology
became a religion<a name="FNanchor_1625" id="FNanchor_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a>&mdash;it was adopted by learned and unlearned,
its ethical and spiritual quality being determined by the character
and thought of the various groups that professed it. For some
centuries it was a religious power in the world; as a religious
system it gave way gradually to more definite constructions, but
it survived as a science long after it had ceased to be believed in
as a life-giving faith.</p>

<p>The persistence of faith in it as a science is an additional illustration
of men's demand for visible signs of the intervention of
the deity in human affairs;<a name="FNanchor_1626" id="FNanchor_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> as often as certain supposed embodiments
of the supernatural are discarded, others are taken up.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>The earlier philosophical views of the relation of the heavenly
bodies to human life are now generally abandoned, and such
belief in this relation as now exists has no scientific basis, but
is founded on vague desire.</p>

<p>In savage and in civilized times eclipses, comets, the appearance
of a new star, and earthquakes have been regarded as indications
of the attitude of the deity&mdash;sometimes favorable, sometimes
unfavorable.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_916" id="p_916">916</a></b>. The words and actions of men and their normal peculiarities
of bodily form have furnished comparatively few divinatory
signs, the reason being, probably, that in early times animals and
other nonhuman things arrested the attention of observers more
forcibly, while in later times such acts and forms were more
readily explained from natural conditions and laws. The palpitation
of the eye, which seems sometimes to uneducated man to be
produced by an external force, has been taken as a presage of
misfortune. A burning sensation in the ear is still believed by
some persons to be a sign that one is being talked about; in
early stages of culture the sensation was regarded as a warning
sent by the guardian spirit or some other superhuman being.
Sneezing was once looked on as a happy omen: when Telemachus
gave a resounding sneeze Penelope interpreted it as a sign that
news of his father was at hand.<a name="FNanchor_1627" id="FNanchor_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> An act performed without
ulterior purpose may be taken to symbolize some sort of fortune.
When the Calif Omar sent an embassy to the Persian
King Yezdegird summoning him to embrace Islam, the angry
king commanded that a clod of earth should be brought and that
the ambassadors should bear it out of the city, which they accordingly
did; and this act was taken both by Arabs and by Persians
as a presage of Moslem victory&mdash;the invaders had a portion of
Persian soil.<a name="FNanchor_1628" id="FNanchor_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> An element of magic, however, may have entered
into this conviction; the bit of soil was supposed, perhaps, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>carry with it the whole land. A chance word has often been
seized on as an indication of the future, or a proper name taken
as a presage.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_917" id="p_917">917</a></b>. The belief in the sacredness or divinity of the human
body has led to the search for divinatory signs in its parts. But
it is only the hand that has been extensively employed in this
way. The hand has offered itself as most available for divination,
partly, perhaps, because of the variety and importance of its
functions, partly because of the variety of lines it shows and the
ease with which it may be examined. Chiromancy, or palmistry,
has been developed into a science and has maintained itself to
the present day; but it has largely lost its divinatory significance
and has become a study of character, which is supposed to be
indicated by the lines of the hand. In its divinatory r&ocirc;le it has
often been connected with astrology.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_918" id="p_918">918</a></b>. The preceding examples deal with occurrences that present
themselves without human initiation. In certain cases the materials
for divination are arranged by men themselves. In such methods
there is always an appeal to the deity, a demand that a god shall
intervene and indicate his will under the conditions prepared by
men, the assumption being that the god has prepared the event
or thing in question, and that, when properly approached, he will
be disposed to give his worshipers the assistance desired. The
casting of lots and similar random procedures have been common
methods of divination the world over. The African Kafir diviner
detects criminals by the fall of small objects used as dice. The
Ashanti discover future events by the figures formed when palm
wine is thrown on the ground, and from the nature of the numbers,
whether even or odd, when one lets fall a handful of nuts.
In a dispute the Yoruban priest holds in his hand a number of
grass stalks, one of which is bent, and the person who draws the
bent stalk is adjudged to be in fault.<a name="FNanchor_1629" id="FNanchor_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a> The Hebrews had the
official use of objects called "urim and thummim" (terms whose
meaning is unknown to us), which were probably small cubes, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>each of which was somehow attached an answer "yes" or "no,"
or the name of a person. Thus, when David inquired whether
he was to attack the Philistines, the answer seems to have been
"yes."<a name="FNanchor_1630" id="FNanchor_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> When it was a question who had violated the taboo
announced by Saul, the urim and thummim first decided that
it was not the people but the royal family; and then, as between
Saul and Jonathan, that it was the latter who was guilty.<a name="FNanchor_1631" id="FNanchor_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> According
to the Book of Ezekiel the Chaldean King Nebuchadrezzar
drew lots by arrows to determine what road he should take in a
campaign.<a name="FNanchor_1632" id="FNanchor_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> The old Arabs employed a species of divination by
arrows, which, when thrown down, by their position indicated
the will of the gods; and in the division of the flesh of a beast
slaughtered by a clan or group, the portions to be assigned to
various persons were determined by the drawing of arrows.<a name="FNanchor_1633" id="FNanchor_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a>
Divination by lot was also largely employed by the Greeks and
the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_1634" id="FNanchor_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> The method called "sortes vergilianae" is still in
vogue; it was and is a custom among pious persons, Christian
or Moslem, to learn the course that they are to take in an
emergency by opening a Bible or a copy of the Koran at random
and accepting the first words on which the eye falls as an
indication of the divine will, the deity being supposed to direct
the eye.<a name="FNanchor_1635" id="FNanchor_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_919" id="p_919">919</a></b>. One of the commonest and most important methods of
divination in antiquity was the examination of the entrails of animals
(haruspication). Of this system there are a few examples
among savage peoples,<a name="FNanchor_1636" id="FNanchor_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> but it has attained special significance
only among the great civilized nations and especially among the
Babylonians, the Etruscans, and the Greeks and Romans. The
slaughtered animal was generally held to be itself sacred or divine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>and, as it was offered to the deity, it was a natural belief that the
god would indicate his will by the character of the inward parts,
which were supposed to be particularly connected with the life of
the animal. Of these animal parts the liver was regarded as the
most important. The liver was for the Babylonians the special seat
of thought, whether from its position or its size or from some other
consideration we have no means of knowing. The explanation of
the form and appearance of the liver became itself a separate science,
and this science was developed with extraordinary minuteness by
the Babylonians. The whole structure of the liver, together with
the gall, bladder, and the ducts, was analyzed, and to every part,
every line, and every difference of appearance a separate significance
was assigned. Thus hepatoscopy, demanding long training
and influencing political action (and, doubtless, calling for ingenuity
and tact in interpretations), assumed great importance in Babylonia
and Assyria; and it was hardly less important among the
Etruscans, the Greeks, and the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_1637" id="FNanchor_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> It is held by some
scholars that Babylonia was the original home of the developed
science, whence it passed into Greece and Italy.<a name="FNanchor_1638" id="FNanchor_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> It may be recognized
in Babylonia in the third millennium <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and there is
no improbability in the supposition that Babylonian influence
was felt in Asia Minor and Eastern Europe; but, in view of the
number of possibly independent centers of culture in this region
in ancient times and the paucity of data, the question may be
left open.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_920" id="p_920">920</a></b>. Other parts of the animal bodies also were employed in
divination. Tylor<a name="FNanchor_1639" id="FNanchor_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> mentions the examination of the bones of the
porcupine among North American Indians, the color giving indications
as to the success of hunting expeditions. The shoulder blade,
when put into the fire, showed by splits in it various kinds of fortune.
The heart was of less significance in ancient thought than
the liver, it being of less size, and its function in the circulation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>of the blood not being known. The brain also did not come,
until a comparatively late period, to be regarded as the seat of
the intellect.<a name="FNanchor_1640" id="FNanchor_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_921" id="p_921">921</a></b>. From these external signs we may now pass to consider
divinatory facts derived from men's inward experience.</p>

<p><i>Dreams.</i> The importance attached all over the world to dreams
as presages is a familiar fact. It would appear that among savage
peoples a dream is regarded as representing an historical fact, the
actual perception of an occurrence or a situation. It is believed
that the mysterious inward thing, the soul, endowed with peculiar
power, is capable, during sleep, of leaving the body and wandering
to and fro;<a name="FNanchor_1641" id="FNanchor_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> why, then, in its journeys, should it not be able to
see the plans of friends and enemies, and in general to observe the
course of events? We do not know the nature of savage logic in
dealing with these visions of the night, but some such line of
reasoning as this, it seems probable, is in their minds. The soul,
they hold, is an entity, possessing intellectual powers like those of
the ordinary living man&mdash;it sees certain things, and its knowledge
becomes the possession of the man when he awakes. Thus the
soul in dreams is a watchman, on the lookout for what may help
or harm the man. Perhaps there is, even in low tribes, a vague
feeling that it has extraordinary powers of perception; whether
such a feeling, if it exists, is connected with a belief that, during
sleep, the soul is freed from the limitations of the everyday corporeal
man we are not able with our present data to say.<a name="FNanchor_1642" id="FNanchor_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a> Savages often
follow the suggestions made in dreams<a name="FNanchor_1643" id="FNanchor_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> (particularly when they
are vivid) and are confirmed in their faith by occasional fulfillments
of predictions; the mind, working during sleep on the observations
made by day, may sometimes fall on situations that afterwards
really appear, and a few such realizations are sufficient to establish
a rule or creed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span><b><a name="p_922" id="p_922">922</a></b>. This na&iuml;ve conception of dreams as products of the soul's
perception of realities survives to a greater or less extent among
higher tribes and nations, but finally gives way, when some sort of
theistic construction is reached, to the view that they are sent immediately
by deities. An approach to this view appears in North
America when, for example, a Pawnee Indian sees in a dream some
being who gives him important information, though in the folk-tales
nothing is said of the source of the dream.<a name="FNanchor_1644" id="FNanchor_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a> A step in advance appears
in the belief of the Ashanti, according to which the existence
of a tutelary family deity is indicated in a dream;<a name="FNanchor_1645" id="FNanchor_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a> it is, however,
not clear whether or not they hold that the tutelary deity has himself
suggested the dream. In the higher religions a dream is often sent
by a patron deity as a prediction or for guidance in a coming emergency.
Doubtless it was only in the case of specially distinct dreams
and such as related to important matters that attention was paid to
them&mdash;the deity intervened only in affairs that called for his special
direction. Examples are numerous in the history of the great nations
of antiquity. The Egyptian King Merneptah in a time of great
danger had a dream in which the god Ptah appeared to him and
bade him banish fear;<a name="FNanchor_1646" id="FNanchor_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> and the Hebrew Yahweh is represented
as having sent dreams to a king of Egypt (probably in the interests
of the Hebrews) to warn him of a coming famine.<a name="FNanchor_1647" id="FNanchor_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> The Assyrian
Ashurbanipal was favored with special communications from Ishtar,
and the god Ashur in a dream ordered Gyges, King of Lydia, to
submit to the Assyrian king.<a name="FNanchor_1648" id="FNanchor_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a> In some documents of the Pentateuch
Yahweh regularly announces his will in dreams to both Hebrews
and non-Hebrews;<a name="FNanchor_1649" id="FNanchor_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a> and a Hebrew writer of a later time (the
third or second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) represents the God of Israel as
giving Nebuchadrezzar an outline of the history of the rise and
fall of the kingdoms of Western Asia and Greece.<a name="FNanchor_1650" id="FNanchor_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> A god might
employ a dream for a less worthy purpose: Zeus sends a dream
to Agamemnon to mislead him and thus direct the issue of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>war.<a name="FNanchor_1651" id="FNanchor_1651"></a><a href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> So important for life did the Greeks conceive the dream
to be that, as it would seem, they personified it.<a name="FNanchor_1652" id="FNanchor_1652"></a><a href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a></p>

<p><i>Incubation.</i> Divine direction by dreams was not always left to
chance. The custom arose of sleeping near a shrine (<i>engkoimesis</i>,
incubation) where, doubtless, after appropriate ritual preparation
the god was expected to signify his will in a dream (his generally
friendly feeling was assumed and the dream would be of the nature
of an answer to prayer). This was one of the means employed by
Saul when he desired to learn what would be the issue of the impending
battle with the Philistines.<a name="FNanchor_1653" id="FNanchor_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a> In Greece, and later in Italy,
the most famous shrine of incubation was that of Asklepios (Aesculapius),
which was widely resorted to and came to exert a good moral
influence.<a name="FNanchor_1654" id="FNanchor_1654"></a><a href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a> The renown of the shrine was doubtless increased by
the fact that Asklepios was a god of healing.<a name="FNanchor_1655" id="FNanchor_1655"></a><a href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_923" id="p_923">923</a></b>. As a dream was often obscure the services of a trained
interpreter became necessary in order that the dream might be
effective. The interpreters were magicians, priests, or sages<a name="FNanchor_1656" id="FNanchor_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a>&mdash;men
in intimate association with deities and acquainted with their
modes and vehicles of revelation;<a name="FNanchor_1657" id="FNanchor_1657"></a><a href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a> dreams thus became equivalent
to oracular responses. An interpreter would become famous in proportion
to the number of fulfillments of his interpretations, and his
god would share in the glory of his renown.<a name="FNanchor_1658" id="FNanchor_1658"></a><a href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a> Of the particular
conditions through which certain men and certain shrines attained
special fame we have few details.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p><p>Oneiromancy, in unorganized form, was studied in very early
periods of religious life. It shared in the general advance of thought,
and in the course of time a traditional science of the explanation
of dreams arose. There were records of experiences, particularly
of notable fulfillments, and it became possible to make lists of
dreams with interpretations;<a name="FNanchor_1659" id="FNanchor_1659"></a><a href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a> these were written down and passed
on from generation to generation, increasing in volume as they
went. Such manuals have played no inconsiderable part in the life
of the people.<a name="FNanchor_1660" id="FNanchor_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_924" id="p_924">924</a></b>. <i>Ordeals.</i> Divination has played an important part in civil
life as a means of determining the guilt or innocence of an accused
person. From very early times ordeals of various sorts have been
devised for securing a judicial opinion when ordinary means of
investigation have failed. One of the simplest methods is to
require an accused person to swear that he is innocent, the belief
being that the god will avenge false swearing with immediate and
visible punishment.<a name="FNanchor_1661" id="FNanchor_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> This method is employed by the Ashanti:<a name="FNanchor_1662" id="FNanchor_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a>
the accused is required to drink a certain decoction; if he is
made sick by it this is proof of his innocence;<a name="FNanchor_1663" id="FNanchor_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a> and if there be
a question between two men, and one after drinking is made sick,
the other is regarded as guilty, and executed. On the Lower
Congo the accused swallows a pill made of a bark said to be
poisonous; if he soon vomits it he is declared innocent, if not,
he is adjudged guilty.<a name="FNanchor_1664" id="FNanchor_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a> A similar procedure was employed in
Samoa:<a name="FNanchor_1665" id="FNanchor_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> standing in the presence of representatives of the village
god, the suspected person laying his hand on the object
wishes that if he is guilty he may speedily die. Among the Hill
people of Ceylon also this custom exists. Ordeals in Loango are
described by Purchas.<a name="FNanchor_1666" id="FNanchor_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span><b><a name="p_925" id="p_925">925</a></b>. Among the ancient nations the earliest example of an
ordeal occurs in the code of Hammurabi (about 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>). Here
the accused is thrown into the sacred water, and if not drowned
is declared innocent; he is protected by the deity.<a name="FNanchor_1667" id="FNanchor_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> The same
principle appears in the old Hebrew ordeal: when a woman
was accused of unfaithfulness to her husband the accused was
made to drink sacred water; if she was innocent no bad consequences
followed; if she was guilty she died.<a name="FNanchor_1668" id="FNanchor_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a> In India,
where various tests by fire, water, and food have been and
are employed, the decision is sometimes as in the Hebrew procedure;
sometimes (when the accused is thrown into the water)
the principle (found elsewhere abundantly) is recognized that it
is the innocent person that suffers and the guilty that is uninjured.<a name="FNanchor_1669" id="FNanchor_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a>
The ordeal as a civil process continued in Europe until
the Middle Ages. In the submersion in water of a woman suspected
of being a witch the principle of decision was the same
as is now practiced in Ashantiland and India&mdash;if the woman
was drowned it was a sign that she was innocent, but if she rose
unharmed from the water she was adjudged guilty and was put
to death.<a name="FNanchor_1670" id="FNanchor_1670"></a><a href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_926" id="p_926">926</a></b>. The imprecation is similar to the ordeal. A man invokes
the curse of the deity on his enemy, and it is supposed that such
curse will bring its punishment.<a name="FNanchor_1671" id="FNanchor_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a> A curse was regarded as an
objective thing, which reached its object quite independently of

and is supposed to become effective if the wrong complained of

effective in fixing guilt; the dread of incurring the wrath of the
deity sometimes forced a guilty person to confess, or his dread of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>the punishment produced signs of guilt. On the other hand, it is
probable that just as often innocent persons were convicted and
punished through such tests.</p>

<p>With all such systems of signs may be compared the Chinese
quasi-science called Fung-Shui ('Wind and Water'), which determines
proper sites for graves and for temples and other buildings
by observations of the influences of the sky (moisture, warmth,
wind, thunder), of waters and hills, and of the earth, and by the
study of various magical combinations. Thus, it is held, it is
possible in important undertakings to obtain the favor and support
of the good Powers of the world. The site of a grave,
affecting the future of the dead, is of especial significance, and
the Fung-Shui interpreters, regularly trained men, levy what contributions
they please from surviving relatives, sometimes purposely
prolonging their investigations at a ruinous cost to the
family of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_1674" id="FNanchor_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> The system sprang from the Chinese
conception of heaven and earth as the controlling Powers of the

<p><b><a name="p_927" id="p_927">927</a></b>. <i>Oracles.</i> As men went to the tents or palaces of chiefs
or kings for guidance in ordinary matters, so they went to the
dwelling places of superhuman Powers for direction in matters
that were beyond human ken. Such appeal to divine or quasi-divine
beings began early in religious history. In Borneo and
the islands of Torres Straits the abodes of skulls are places from
which responses are obtained;<a name="FNanchor_1676" id="FNanchor_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> speaking heads are found there
and elsewhere. The Sunthals of West Bengal have the ghost of
a specially revered ancestor as a dispenser of superhuman knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_1677" id="FNanchor_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a>
When local gods arose every local shrine, it is probable,

acquired special prominence, their oracles were consulted by kings
and other leaders on affairs of importance, and thus came to exert
a great influence on the course of events.<a name="FNanchor_1679" id="FNanchor_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> The stars also, though
they had no earthly habitations, were consulted through their interpreters.
Such astrological oracles, as used by men like Posidonius,
the teacher of Cicero, might be morally inspiring; but
when, at a later time, the consultation of heavenly bodies fell
into the hands of wandering "Chaldeans" (who might be of
any nation) it became a system of charlatanry, and thus morally
debasing.<a name="FNanchor_1680" id="FNanchor_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a></p>

<p>The greater nations of antiquity differed considerably among
themselves in regard to the part played in their lives by oracles.
In general, the organization of oracular shrines grew in proportion
to the rise of manlike gods&mdash;deities whose relation to men was
socially intimate. In Egypt such shrines were not of prime importance;<a name="FNanchor_1681" id="FNanchor_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a>
the functions of the gods were mainly governmental&mdash;the
most human of them, Osiris, became an ethical judge rather
than a personal friend. The pre-Mohammedan Arabs did not
create great gods, and their resort to local divinities was commonly
in order to ask whether or not a proposed course of action was
desirable; the answer was "yes" or "no."<a name="FNanchor_1682" id="FNanchor_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a> The famous warrior
and poet, Imru'l-Kais, desiring to go to war to avenge his father's
death, received at a shrine three times a negative answer, whereupon,
hurling abusive epithets at the god, he exclaimed, "If it
were your father, you would not say 'no.'" Such independence
was probably rare; most men would have accepted the divine
decision. The answer of the Hebrew oracle was, as among the
Arabs, "yes" or "no" (by urim and thummim)&mdash;the gods were
remote, and the oracle, whose minister was a priest, gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>yielded to the prophet, the human interpreter of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_1683" id="FNanchor_1683"></a><a href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a>
The Philistines appear to have had well-organized oracles; when
King Ahaziah was sick he sent to inquire of Baalzebub, god of
Ekron, whether or not he should recover.<a name="FNanchor_1684" id="FNanchor_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a> Many Babylonian and
Assyrian deities gave oracular responses;<a name="FNanchor_1685" id="FNanchor_1685"></a><a href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> it is not known whether
the shrines were resorted to by the people at large, and their importance
was probably diminished by the great r&ocirc;le played by
the priestly interpretation of omens, whereby the will of the gods
was held to be clearly revealed. The Romans under the republic
were practically independent of oracles at shrines: in household
affairs they had a family god for every department and every
situation, and for State matters they found the Sibylline oracles
sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_1686" id="FNanchor_1686"></a><a href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> Later, with the widening of the horizon of religion,
the resort to Greek and other oracular shrines became general&mdash;a
departure from the old Roman constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1687" id="FNanchor_1687"></a><a href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a> The greatest
development of oracular service took place in Greece. The Greek
gods, with their anthropomorphically emotional characters, entered
intimately and sympathetically into human life, communal and individual.
The great shrines of Zeus at Dodona and Apollo at
Delphi were centers of Hellenistic religious life, and there were
others of less importance.<a name="FNanchor_1688" id="FNanchor_1688"></a><a href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a> Zeus, as head of the pantheon, naturally
took a distinguished place as patron of oracles; and Apollo's
relation to music and inspiration may account in part for the
pre&euml;minence of his oracular shrine. In many cases, however,
the grounds of the choice of a particular deity as oracle-giver
escape us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span></p><p>The human demand for divine guidance long maintained the
influence of oracles everywhere, and it is not improbable that in
general they furthered what was good religiously and socially.
They were bonds of union between communities, and their
authoritative r&ocirc;le would naturally force on them a certain sense
of responsibility. As to the character of the mouthpieces of the
gods and the material on which they based their answers to
questions we have not the means of forming a definite opinion.
There can be little doubt that the official persons were sometimes
sincere in the belief that they were inspired&mdash;such is the testimony
of observers for both savage and civilized communities&mdash;and
many modern instances bear out this view. On the other hand,
there is reason to suppose that pretense and fraud often crept
into the administration of the oracles. When the questions were
known beforehand the responses may have been based on information
that came from various quarters and on insight into
the particular situation about which the inquiry was made. When
the questions were not known beforehand we are in the dark as
to the source of the answers. Sometimes, doubtless, they were
happy or unhappy guesses; sometimes they were enigmatical or
ambiguous in form, so that they could be made to agree with the
events that actually occurred. In most cases the authorities would
know how to explain the issue in such a way as to maintain the
credit of the oracle. The best-known and the most impressive of
the utterers of oracles is the priestess of Apollo at Delphi, the
Pythia. She occupied a commanding position in the Hellenic
world (and beyond it), such as was enjoyed by few persons of
the time.<a name="FNanchor_1689" id="FNanchor_1689"></a><a href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a> She was invested with special sanctity as the dispenser
of divine guidance to the Western world (to nations and individuals).
It was required of her that she be morally and ceremonially
pure, and she had to undergo a special preparation for
the delivery of her message. The manner of her revelation did
not differ from that of similar officials in noncivilized communities&mdash;she
spoke in a condition of ecstasy; she is the best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>representative of the intimate union of the diviner and a great
god, a union that tended to give dignity and wisdom as well as
authority to the oracular utterance.<a name="FNanchor_1690" id="FNanchor_1690"></a><a href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">1690</a> She was, thus, in the best
position for exerting a good influence on the world of her time.
How far the oracles of Apollo and other deities furthered the
best interests of religion it may be difficult to say&mdash;the data
for an exact answer are lacking. Socially they were useful in
maintaining a certain unity among peoples, and they may sometimes
have upheld justice and given judicious advice, but they
were always exposed to the temptation of fraud.</p>

<p><i>Necromancy.</i> While in ancient times the dead were everywhere
placated by gifts and were sometimes worshiped, the consultation
of them for guidance seems to have been relatively infrequent.
The attitude of existing lower tribes toward ghosts varies in different
places,<a name="FNanchor_1691" id="FNanchor_1691"></a><a href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a> but the predominant feeling seems to be fear;
these tribes have not accomplished that social union between
themselves and the departed without which, as it appears, the
living do not feel free to apply to the latter for information concerning
things past, present, and future.<a name="FNanchor_1692" id="FNanchor_1692"></a><a href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> Savage and half-civilized
peoples depend for such information on divination by means of
common phenomena (omens) and on the offices of magicians and
soothsayers, and references in published reports to necromantic
usages among them are rare and vague. But among civilized
peoples also application to the dead is not as frequent as might
be expected; there is still fear of ghosts, and the part assigned
in early times to spirits in the administration of human life has
been given over to gods&mdash;family divinities and the great oracular
deities supply the information that men need. There are few signs
of dependence on necromancy in China, India, Persia, and Rome.
The Babylonian mythical hero Gilgamesh procures (through the
aid of an Underworld god) an interview with his dead friend
Eabani in order to learn the nature of the life below;<a name="FNanchor_1693" id="FNanchor_1693"></a><a href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a> this story
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>points, perhaps, to necromantic usages, but in the extant literature
there are no details of such usages. Application to the dead is certified
for the old Hebrews not only by the story of Saul's consultation
of Samuel (which, though a folk-story, may be taken to prove a
popular custom) but by a prophetic passage condemning the practice.<a name="FNanchor_1694" id="FNanchor_1694"></a><a href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a>
Teraphim were employed, probably, for divination, but there
is no proof that they were connected with necromancy.<a name="FNanchor_1695" id="FNanchor_1695"></a><a href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a> After the
sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> we hear nothing of consultation of the dead by the
pre-Christian Jews. Among the Greeks also such consultation seems
not to have enjoyed a high degree of favor. There were oracles of
the dead (of heroes and others), but these were inferior in importance
to the oracles of the great gods<a name="FNanchor_1696" id="FNanchor_1696"></a><a href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a> and gradually ceased to be
resorted to. Where the practice of incubation existed, answers to inquiries
were sometimes, doubtless, held to come from the dead, but
more commonly it was a god that supplied the desired information.</p>

<p>The stages in the history of necromantic practice follow the
lines of growth of psychical and theistic beliefs. There was first
the era of spirits when men were doubtful of the friendliness of
ghosts, and held it safer in general to trust to soothsayers for
guidance in life. Then, when the gods took distinct shape, they
largely displaced ghosts as dispensers of knowledge of the future,
and these latter, standing outside of and in rivalry with the circle
of State deities, could be approached only in secret&mdash;necromancy
became illicit and its influence was crippled. And when, finally,
in the earlier centuries of our era, the old gods disappeared, the
rise of monotheistic belief was accompanied by a transformation
of the conception of the future of the soul; it was to be no
longer the inert earthly thing of the old theories but instinct with
a high life that fitted it to be the companion of divine beings and
the sharer of their knowledge and their ideals.<a name="FNanchor_1697" id="FNanchor_1697"></a><a href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> This conception
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>led to the belief in the possibility of a nonmagical friendly intercourse
with the departed, who, it was assumed, would be willing
to impart their knowledge to their brethren on earth. Saints have
thus been appealed to, and it has been attempted in recent times
to enter into communication with departed kin and other friends.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_928" id="p_928">928</a></b>. The office of diviner, though it has always been an influential
one, has followed in its development the general course
of social organization, becoming more and more specialized and
defined. In the simplest religions the positions of magician and
diviner are frequently united in one person. In Greenland the
Angekok, acting as the interpreter or mouthpiece of a supernatural
being from whom men learn how they may be fortunate,
foretells the condition of the weather and the fortunes of fishing.<a name="FNanchor_1698" id="FNanchor_1698"></a><a href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a>
A similar combination of the offices is found among the Ainu,
and apparently among the Cakchiquels, among whom the divining
function is said to have related particularly to war.<a name="FNanchor_1699" id="FNanchor_1699"></a><a href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_929" id="p_929">929</a></b>. There was, however, as is remarked above, a tendency
to invest the priest with the function of divination. The Arabian
<i>kahin</i> was a soothsayer, the Hebrew <i>kohen</i> was a priest.<a name="FNanchor_1700" id="FNanchor_1700"></a><a href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> The
Yorubans have a special god of divination whose priest is the
soothsayer of the community. In Ashantiland priests and priestesses,
who are exceedingly influential and powerful, owe a great
deal of their importance to their ability to explain signs and
omens, especially to discover guilt and to foretell events.<a name="FNanchor_1701" id="FNanchor_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> In the
elaborate divinatory ceremonies of the Ahoms of Southeastern
Asia, the conductors, who are highly considered in the community,
are priests; these people are partly Hinduized, but probably
retain much of their ancient religious forms.<a name="FNanchor_1702" id="FNanchor_1702"></a><a href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">1702</a> A noteworthy
specialization of functions is found among the Todas of Southern
India, who distinguish the diviner from the magician, the prophet,
and the dairyman. The diviner is inspired by a god, gives his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>utterances in an ecstatic state, and for the most part limits himself
to the explanation of the origin of misfortunes.<a name="FNanchor_1703" id="FNanchor_1703"></a><a href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a> It would be
a matter of interest to trace, if it were possible, a history of this
specialization, but the early fortunes of the Toda religion are
without records and can only be surmised. In ancient Gaul
the diviner, it is said, was distinguished from the priest and the
prophet.<a name="FNanchor_1704" id="FNanchor_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a> Where divination is the duty of the priestly body,
there is sometimes a differentiation within this body, some persons
devoting themselves specifically to soothsaying; so among
the Babylonians, where this function was most important.<a name="FNanchor_1705" id="FNanchor_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_930" id="p_930">930</a></b>. Among the old Hebrews the soothsaying function is
connected not only with priests but also with prophets.<a name="FNanchor_1706" id="FNanchor_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a> The
priest was the official diviner, employing the urim and thummim.
Prophets and dreamers are mentioned together as persons of the
same class and as sometimes employing their arts for purposes
contrary to the national religion; various classes of diviners are
mentioned as existing among the Israelites in the seventh century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, but the distinctions between them are not given.<a name="FNanchor_1707" id="FNanchor_1707"></a><a href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">1707</a> From
a statement in Isaiah ii, 6, it may perhaps be inferred that some
form of divination was imported into Israel in the eighth century
or earlier from the more developed Philistines and from the countries
east of the Jordan;<a name="FNanchor_1708" id="FNanchor_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a> and the passage just referred to in Deuteronomy
probably reveals Assyrian influence. While the Egyptian
documents have much to say of magic, they give little information
with regard to the existence of a class of diviners; but it appears,
according to a Hebrew writer,<a name="FNanchor_1709" id="FNanchor_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a> that the art of divination might
belong to any prominent person&mdash;Joseph is represented as divining
from a cup.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_931" id="p_931">931</a></b>. The greatest development of the office of the diviner in
ancient times was found among the Greeks and Romans.<a name="FNanchor_1710" id="FNanchor_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>Greek word <i>mantis</i> appears to have been a general term for any
person, male or female, who had the power of perceiving the will
of the gods. The early distinction between the <i>mantis</i> and the
<i>prophetes</i> is not clear. Plato, indeed, distinguishes sharply between
the two terms:<a name="FNanchor_1711" id="FNanchor_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> the <i>mantis</i>, he says, while in an ecstatic state
cannot understand his own utterances, and it is, therefore, the
custom to appoint a <i>prophetes</i> who shall interpret for him; some
persons, he adds, give the name <i>mantis</i> to this interpreter, but
he is only a <i>prophetes</i>. We find, however, that the terms are
frequently used interchangeably; thus the Pythia is called both
<i>mantis</i> and <i>prophetis</i>. Whatever may have been the original sense
of these terms, the office of diviner in Greece was in the main
separate from that of priest. It is found attached to families and
was hereditary. It was recognized by the State from an early
time and became more and more influential. According to Xenophon
Socrates believed in and approved divination.<a name="FNanchor_1712" id="FNanchor_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a> Plato held
that it was a gift of the gods, and that official persons so gifted
were to be held in high esteem.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_932" id="p_932">932</a></b>. In Rome, in accordance with the genius of the nation, soothsaying
was at a comparatively early period organized and taken in
charge by the State. There were colleges of augurs,<a name="FNanchor_1713" id="FNanchor_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a> standing in
various relations to political and social life, having their heads (chief
augurs)&mdash;thus in their organization similar to the priesthood, but
standing quite apart from this. The same sort of organization was
established in the Etruscan office of <i>haruspex</i><a name="FNanchor_1714" id="FNanchor_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> when this was introduced
into Rome. The members of these colleges were at first
Etruscans and, as such, looked down on; but gradually Roman
youth of good family and education were trained for the duty, and
in the time of the Emperor Claudius the social difference between
augurs and haruspices seems to have been almost eliminated.<a name="FNanchor_1715" id="FNanchor_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span><b><a name="p_933" id="p_933">933</a></b>. <i>Sibyls.</i> In the old Gr&aelig;co-Roman world inspired women
played a great r&ocirc;le.<a name="FNanchor_1716" id="FNanchor_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a> The belief in such personages goes back to
the old conception of the possession of human beings by a supernatural
being, which, as we have seen, was common in early
forms of religion. This idea assumed various shapes in Greece,
and in the course of time the inspired women were connected
with various deities. In the Dionysus cult the orgiastic rites (in
which women took a chief part) seem to have grown up from
old agricultural ceremonies in which the spirit or god of vegetation
was invoked to give his aid. Such ceremonies naturally
coalesced here as elsewhere with the license of popular festivities.
The legends connected with the Dionysus cult introduced savage
features into the rites, as, for example, in the story of Pentheus.<a name="FNanchor_1717" id="FNanchor_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a>
But whatever may have been the case in Thrace, whence the
cult came to Greece, it was not so in historical times in Greece,
where the celebrations were controlled by the State. These exhibit
then only the natural frenzy of excited crowds without the
element of divination.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_934" id="p_934">934</a></b>. The development of the r&ocirc;le of women as representatives
of deities is illustrated by the character of the priestesses of oracular
shrines.<a name="FNanchor_1718" id="FNanchor_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a> These, like the Dionysiac devotees, are seized and possessed
by the god, and speak in a state of frenzy. But their
frenzy is controlled by civilized conditions. It exists only as a
preparation for divination; it is the movement of the god in them
laboring to express himself, and his expression is couched in intelligible
human language. The priestess is a part of an organized and
humanized cult and, as such, represents to a certain extent the ideas
of a civilized society. The Dionysiac woman yields to an excess of
animal excitement, without thought for society; the priestess feels
herself responsible to society. A similar progress in civilized feeling
appears among the old Hebrews; the incoherency of the earlier
prophets<a name="FNanchor_1719" id="FNanchor_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> gives way to the thoughtful discourses of the ethical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>leaders.<a name="FNanchor_1720" id="FNanchor_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> The manner and the expression of revelation always
conform to existing social usages.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_935" id="p_935">935</a></b>. Of a still different character is the figure of the Sibyl,
created by the Greeks and adopted by the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_1721" id="FNanchor_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a> She, too,
is possessed by a god and sometimes, at least, raves in ecstasy;
but she does not officiate at a shrine and is not controlled by
any official body. She dwells in a cave or a grotto, has her life
in the open air, and gives her answers on the leaves of the
forest. She represents the divine voices that are heard by early
men everywhere in the world; in the myth, when she displeases
Apollo she is condemned to fade finally, after a long life, into a
voice.<a name="FNanchor_1722" id="FNanchor_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> She is not, like the Pythia, an actual human being&mdash;she
is never seen except in legends and myths. She is a creature of
Greek imagination, the embodiment of all the divine suggestions
that come to man from the mysterious sounds around him.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_936" id="p_936">936</a></b>. The historical origin of the fully developed figure of the
Sibyl is obscure.<a name="FNanchor_1723" id="FNanchor_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> In the literature she appears first in the sixth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> along with the Pythia, but she was then thought of
as well established and ancient. She is not mentioned by Homer
or Hesiod, but their silence is not proof positive that the conception
of the character did not exist in their time; they may have
had no occasion to mention her, or the figure may have been so
vague and unimportant as not to call for special mention. For
such a figure it is natural to assume a long development, the
beginnings of which are, of course, enveloped in obscurity. However
this may be, the Sibyl appears to have received full form
under the religious impulse of post-Homeric times, under conditions
the details of which are not known to us.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_937" id="p_937">937</a></b>. In the scant notices of the figure that have been preserved
the indications are that there was originally only one
Sibyl&mdash;she was the mythical embodiment of divine revelation, as
the muse was the embodiment of intellectual inspiration. At a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>later time many sibyls came into being; Varro reckons ten and
other authors give other numbers. Apparently a process of local
differentiation went on; when the idea of the revealer was once
established and the historical beginnings of the figure were unknown,
many a place would be ambitious to have so noble a
figure domiciled in its midst. One line of tradition referred the
original Sibyl to the Ionian Erythr&aelig;, and when the Sibylline
Books were burned in the year 83 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, it was to Erythr&aelig; that
the Romans sent to make a new collection of oracles. Whatever
the original home of the figure, one of the most famous of the
Sibyls was she of Cum&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_1724" id="FNanchor_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> She was regarded as being very old,
and she was probably a permanent diviner of that place. It was
from Cum&aelig;, according to the legend, that the Sibylline Books
came to Rome. The story of how they were first offered to King
Tarquinius Priscus, who refused to pay the price, how three of
them were destroyed and then three more, and how finally the
required price was paid for the remaining three, points to a belief
that the material of the oracles had once been larger than that
which came to Rome. There is also the assertion that the utterances
of the Sibyl were at that time recorded in books. This fact
suggests that oracular responses had long been known at Cum&aelig;,
and that some persons, of whose character and functions we
know nothing, had from time to time written them down, so
that a handbook of divination had come into existence.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_938" id="p_938">938</a></b>. In whatever manner the oracles were first brought to
Rome it is certain that they were accepted by the Romans in
all good faith, and they came to play a very important part in
the conduct of public affairs. They were placed in the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus under the charge of two men (<i>duumviri</i>), and
later a college was established for their guardianship. They were
used in Rome especially for guidance in national calamities: when
the existence of the city was threatened by the victorious career
of Hannibal, it was the Sibyl who prescribed the importation of
the worship of the Phrygian Great Mother. It is certain that the
books were manipulated by political and religious leaders for their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>own purposes, old dicta being recast and new ones inserted as
occasion required;<a name="FNanchor_1725" id="FNanchor_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a> but probably this procedure was unknown to
the people&mdash;it does not appear that it affected their faith. Even
Augustine speaks of the theurgi as d&aelig;mones, and cites a passage
from the Erythr&aelig;an Sibyl as a prediction of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_1726" id="FNanchor_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_939" id="p_939">939</a></b>. To the poetical books which have come down to us under
the name of Jewish Sibylline Oracles no value attaches for the
history of the Sibyl except so far as they are an indication of the
hold that the conception kept on men's minds.<a name="FNanchor_1727" id="FNanchor_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a> They are a product
of the passion for apocalyptic writing that prevailed among the Jews
and Christians in Palestine and Alexandria, from the second century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> into the third century of our era. The fame of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman
Sibyl was widespread, and to the Jews and Christians of
that time it seemed proper that she should be made to predict the
history of Judaism and Christianity; possibly it was believed that
such a prophetess must have spoken of this history. Naturally the
Jewish Sibyl has a Biblical genealogy&mdash;she is the daughter of Noah.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_940" id="p_940">940</a></b>. Her utterances, given in heavy Greek hexameters, have
been preserved for us in a great mass of ill-arranged fragments,
with many repetitions, indicating them as the work of various
authors. What we have is clearly only a part of what was produced,
but the nature of the whole body of pseudo-predictions is
easily understood from the material that has been preserved. They
follow the history down to the author's time, giving it sometimes
an enigmatical form, and the future is described in vague phrases
that embody the guesses or hopes of the writer. It seems certain
that all of the existent material of these oracles is from Jewish
and Christian hands. Even when Greek mythical stories are introduced,
as in the euhemeristic description of the origin of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>Greek dynasties of gods in the third book, the whole is conceived
under the forms of Jewish or Christian thought. The Sibyllines
are quoted by Josephus and by many Christian writers from
Justin Martyr to Augustine and Jerome and later. They give a
picture of certain Jewish and Christian ideas of the period and of
the opinions held concerning certain political events, but otherwise
have no historical value. An illustration of the fact that the
belief in them as real inspired prediction continued to a late time
is found in the hymn <i>Dies Irae</i>, in which the Sibyl is cited along
with David as a prophet of the last judgment. The whole history
of the figure is a remarkable illustration of the power of a written
record, held to be a divine revelation, to impress men's minds and
control their beliefs and actions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_941" id="p_941">941</a></b>. While divination has played a great part in the religious
history of the world, it has rarely brought about important political
or religious results.<a name="FNanchor_1728" id="FNanchor_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> The exceptions are the great Greek oracles
of Dodona and Delphi and the Roman Sibylline Books; to these
last, as is observed above, the Roman people owed the introduction
of some important religious cults. But for ordinary procedures
priests and other officiators everywhere were disposed to give
favorable responses, especially to the questions of prominent men;
and military and other political enterprises were usually in such
form that they could not conveniently be modified in accordance
with unfavorable omens&mdash;the omen had to be favorable. There
were exceptions, but this was the general rule. The science of
divination, however, did good service in fostering the observation
of natural phenomena, and especially in the development of astronomy
and anatomy. In connection with these observations it called
into being bodies of men&mdash;corporations that in process of time
became centers of general culture.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_942" id="p_942">942</a></b>. On the ethical side it may be doubted whether divination
has been an advantage to society. It has produced much deceit,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>unconscious and conscious. Whether diviners believed or did not
believe in their science, the result was bad. If they did not believe,
they fostered a system of deceit. Whether there was real belief or
not, the practice of divination encouraged false methods and turned
men's minds away from immediate appeals to the deity, and in
general from a spiritual conception of religion. On the other hand,
it helped to maintain the external apparatus of religion, which for
ancient life was an important thing. Like all great institutions its
effects have been partly good, partly bad. It belongs to a lower
stage of human thought and tends to disappear gradually before
enlightenment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>THE HIGHER THEISTIC DEVELOPMENT</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_943" id="p_943">943</a></b>. The preceding survey of early religious customs and institutions
discloses a recognizable unity in diversity. Everywhere we
find the same classes of sacred objects and the same methods of
approaching them. Whether the supernatural Powers are conceived
of as animals or as plants or as what we call inanimate things, or,
in more advanced thought, as ghosts or spirits or gods, they are
held to be factors in human life, are regarded with awe, are dreaded
and avoided, or are welcomed as helpers, and in any case are propitiated
by gifts and other marks of respect. The potency inherent
in things is the object of observation, its laws are studied, and it is
used for purposes of life. The diversities in the form of ceremonies,
in the conception of the characters of the Powers, and in the general
tone and coloring of worship arise from economic and cultural differences,
and are as numerous as the tribes of men; the unity of
cults is a result of the psychological unity of the human race&mdash;the
religious needs of men in all stages of culture are the same; there
is nothing in the highest religious systems that is not found in germ
in the lowest.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_944" id="p_944">944</a></b>. The earliest expression of religious feeling, as is pointed
out above,<a name="FNanchor_1729" id="FNanchor_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> is in the form of ceremonies. But ceremonies tend to
group themselves round the persons of divine beings. Gods, as
the controllers of human fortunes here and hereafter, naturally become
the centers of religious thought. Their characters and functions
reflect the ideals of their worshipers, and all ritualistic and
other usages and all doctrines concerning the relations between
gods and men and, in general, all ideas concerning the physical
and moral constitution of the world attach themselves perforce to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>the divine embodiments of these ideals. Thus, in one sense, the
history of the gods is the history of religion. From the earliest
times up to the present the efforts of men have been directed
toward defining the divine Powers that have been supposed to
stand behind all phenomena. The problem of harmonizing diverse
divine activities has always been a serious one, and its solution has
been sought in various ways. Gods have been locally limited, every
one to his own human tribe, district, or nation; or, when they dwell
together and their spheres of influence are larger, they have been
given free scope of action, and the resulting contradictions in human
affairs have been accepted as a part of the mysterious nature of
things; or order has been sought in simplification&mdash;headship has
been ascribed to some one deity, and the relation between him and
the subordinate divinities has been somehow explained or has been
left unexplained. The process of simplification has gone steadily
on with the result that the great religious systems of the world fall
into groups distinguished from one another by their conceptions of
the divine government of the world, whether as pluralistic or as
unitary. The development of these different conceptions may be
traced here in outline, though the absence of exact data and the
variety and complexity of the formative influences (economic, philosophical,
political, and other) necessarily make it difficult or impossible
to account satisfactorily for all details. The groups to be
considered are polytheism, dualism, and monotheism, to which may
be added brief mention of systems that do not recognize a personal
divine ruler of the world.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Polytheism</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_945" id="p_945">945</a></b>. The first stage in the final theistic history of the world up
to the present day, polytheism, appears in all the great civilized
nations. The great polytheistic systems have much in common:
for example, protection of civil order and morality by a god; prominence
of the god of a ruling tribe or family or of a great city;
disposition to embody certain general facts, as war, love, learning,
in divine figures; tendency to make some god universal. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
other hand, they differ among themselves in certain regards: in the
degree of specialization and differentiation of divine functions, and
in the stress that they lay on the various departments of human
life. Their agreements and disagreements seem to be in some
cases independent of racial relations and climatic conditions; their
roots lie so far back in history that we have no means of tracing
their genesis and development.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_946" id="p_946">946</a></b>. The Egyptian and the Semitic peoples were parts of the
same original stock,<a name="FNanchor_1730" id="FNanchor_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a> and their systems of social and political organization
were substantially identical&mdash;the government in its developed
form was monarchical, but tribal and other locally isolated
forms of organization maintained themselves to a certain extent&mdash;and
their literary and artistic outputs do not differ materially. We
might, then, expect their religions to be in the main identical. In
fact they agree in having a relative meagerness of theistic differentiation,
but in some important points they are far apart. The
Semites were indifferent to the future life, the Egyptians constructed
it elaborately (in this point taking precedence among the
ancients); the Semites were averse to divinizing human beings, for
the Egyptians kings were divine. In this last point Egypt resembles
China, but in other respects is at a world-wide remove from it.
Other peoples thought of their gods as having relations with beasts;
the Egyptians alone, among civilized nations, worshiped the living
animal.<a name="FNanchor_1731" id="FNanchor_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> Some Greek writers regarded Egypt as the religious mother
of Greece, but Hellenic cults show little resemblance to Egyptian.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_947" id="p_947">947</a></b>. The Hebrews had the general Semitic theistic and cultic
scheme, but in their capacity (in their higher development) to content
themselves with one deity, and in their elaboration of ritualistic
forms and institutions, were more closely akin to the Aryan Persians
than to any Semitic community, and borrowed freely from them.
The resemblance between the two cults, however, was confined to
these two points; in other respects they were very different.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_948" id="p_948">948</a></b>. The linguistic identity of the Indo-European peoples does
not carry with it theologic identity. The theistic scheme of India
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>is more nearly allied, in the disposition to grant equality of significance
to all gods, to the Egyptian and Semitic than to the Persian
and the Greek, yet the tone and color of the Hindu deities do
not resemble the tone and color of the Egyptian and Babylonian
divinities.</p>

<p>Even between Greece and Rome the religious differences are
great. Greece stands alone in its artistic creation of divine forms.
Rome rather resembles the Hebrews in its sobriety of theistic
creations, and particularly is like the Chinese in the purpose to
make religion subservient to the interests of the family and the
State; Roman religion, like Chinese, might be described as a body
of public and private ceremonies to which gods were attached.<a name="FNanchor_1732" id="FNanchor_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a>
The Roman gods, however, are much more definite figures than
the Chinese; the latter are either unimportant folk-gods or powers
of nature.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_949" id="p_949">949</a></b>. The contrast between Mexico, with its considerable number
of departmental gods, some of them savage, and Peru, whose quasi-monotheistic
system is relatively mild, is striking. But the origin of
these two peoples (who perhaps are made up of different sets of
tribes) is involved in obscurity, and it is uncertain whether or not we
should expect a greater resemblance between their cults.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_950" id="p_950">950</a></b>. The differentiation in the theistic scheme of the Teutons,
especially the Scandinavians, is noteworthy. Several of their deities,
particularly Wodan (Odin), Thor, and Loki, are well-developed
persons, and these and some others do not differ materially in
character from the earlier corresponding Hindu and Greek gods.
A comparison between the Teutonic figures and the Celtic and
Slavic would be pertinent if we knew more of the character of
these last; but the information about them is slight.<a name="FNanchor_1733" id="FNanchor_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_951" id="p_951">951</a></b>. The extent of the anthropomorphization of gods in any
system may be measured by the richness and refinement of its
mythology. When the gods live apart from men, being conceived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>of mainly as transcendent Powers, or when they are not fully developed
men, there is little room for the play of social emotions
and for the creation of biographies of individual deities. It is the
humanized god that has emotional life, and it is in this mythical
life that the religious feeling of the worshiper is expressed with
greatest fullness of detail.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_952" id="p_952">952</a></b>. The development of mythology through all its gradations
of fullness and fineness can be traced in the religious systems of
the world.<a name="FNanchor_1734" id="FNanchor_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> Where there is no recognizable worship there is, of
course, no mythology. This is the case in Australia, in Pygmy
lands, in Tierra del Fuego, in parts of New Guinea, and perhaps
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1735" id="FNanchor_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a> Scarcely above these are parts of Central and Southern
Africa, the countries of the Bantu, the Hottentots, and the Bushmen.<a name="FNanchor_1736" id="FNanchor_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a>
A feeble mythological invention appears among the Zulus,
whose conception of gods is indistinct;<a name="FNanchor_1737" id="FNanchor_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> and the Masai and the
Nandi, who are somewhat farther advanced in the construction of
deities, show mythop&oelig;ic imagination in a single case only (the
famous myth of the embrace of the earth and the sky), and this is
perhaps borrowed.<a name="FNanchor_1738" id="FNanchor_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> Along with these we may place the Todas
whose theogonic conceptions appear to have been cramped by
their buffalo cult, and their mythical material is small and vague.<a name="FNanchor_1739" id="FNanchor_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_953" id="p_953">953</a></b>. A somewhat higher stage of mythopoeic development is
represented by peoples of Oceania and North America. The myths
are still prevailingly cosmologic and sociologic, but the beginning
of biographical sketches of supernatural Powers is visible. The
Melanesian Qat and the Polynesian Maui are on the border line
between culture-heroes and gods, but they are real persons, and
their adventures, while they describe origins, are also descriptions
of character. Hawaii and Borneo have departmental gods and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>a body of stories about them.<a name="FNanchor_1740" id="FNanchor_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a> Certain tribes of Redmen have not
only divine genealogical systems but also narratives resembling the
Melanesian in character, the line between myth proper and folk-lore
being often hard to trace.<a name="FNanchor_1741" id="FNanchor_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a> The stories fall into more or less well-defined
groups, and of the Coyote and, less definitely, of certain
other personages biographies might be written.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_954" id="p_954">954</a></b>. The half-civilized peoples of Madagascar, West Africa
(Dahomi, Ashanti, Yoruba), the Malay Peninsula, and Southern
India (Khonds) have more coherent figures and stories of divine
personages.<a name="FNanchor_1742" id="FNanchor_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a> Here something like living human beings appear,
though there is crudeness in the portraiture, and the interest is
chiefly in the history of origins. The Malayan and Khond figures
are especially noteworthy, but are not free from the suspicion of
influence from higher religions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_955" id="p_955">955</a></b>. True literary mythology is found only in civilized peoples,
and among these a gradation is recognizable. We have first the
stage of culture represented by the Japanese, the Finns, the Mexicans,
and the Peruvians, with fairly well-developed gods, who have
emotions and histories. In this group Japan takes the lowest
place;<a name="FNanchor_1743" id="FNanchor_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> it is chiefly in the figures regarded as deified men that
definiteness of character and human warmth are found. Japanese
theogony was depressed by the interest of the people in family and
State organization; the gods, though civilized, are vague personalities.
The Finnish literary mythical material, given in the Kalevala,
has a highly humanized coloring and is worked up into a coherent
story; the social system revealed in the myths is superior in many
regards to that of the Redmen, but the theistic scheme is crude.<a name="FNanchor_1744" id="FNanchor_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>The few Mexican myths that have come down to us (probably
only the remains out of a large mass) show reflection and portray
human experiences.<a name="FNanchor_1745" id="FNanchor_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a> Both in Mexico and in Peru the Spanish
conquest appears to have destroyed no little material that, if preserved,
would have illustrated the mythical constructions of these
lands. In Peru, further, it may be that the monotheistic tinge of
the State religion had the effect of banishing subordinate deities
and the stories connected with them. For whatever reason little
is known of its mythical material, but the little that is known
shows a certain degree of refinement. South America, excluding
Peru, has no mythical constructions of interest.<a name="FNanchor_1746" id="FNanchor_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_956" id="p_956">956</a></b>. Of the great religions the Chinese may be passed by in
the present sketch; its form leaves no place for mythology; its
virtual monotheism excludes lesser supernatural figures as actors
in the drama of human life.<a name="FNanchor_1747" id="FNanchor_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_957" id="p_957">957</a></b>. The Persian cosmogonic myths are merely statements of
great facts without biographical features. In the hands of late
writers they shaded into legendary accounts of the origin of the
kingdom, and the whole was colored by the developed Mazdaism.
We thus have theological constructions rather than true myths.<a name="FNanchor_1748" id="FNanchor_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a>
The few mythical stories that have survived play an insignificant
part in the religious system&mdash;a sort of result that is to be expected
whenever a substantially definite monotheistic conception
has been reached.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_958" id="p_958">958</a></b>. Egypt produced a couple of myths of great interest.<a name="FNanchor_1749" id="FNanchor_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> The
story of Ra's anger with men, and his act of wholesale destruction,
belongs in the group of myths (in which flood stories and others
are included) the motif of which is antagonism between gods and
men. The conception of such antagonism seems to go back to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>early opinion that all misfortunes were caused by supernatural
beings; in civilized times some great calamity would be singled
out as a special result of divine anger, and imagination would
construct a history of the event, why the god was angry, and how
he was appeased. What particular occurrence this Egyptian story
refers to is unknown.</p>

<p>The Osiris myth has better literary form and more cultic significance.<a name="FNanchor_1750" id="FNanchor_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a>
The slaying of Osiris by Set, Isis's search for the body of
her husband, and the r&ocirc;le of the young Horus as avenger of his
father make a coherent history. Osiris had the singular fortune of
being the most widely popular god in Egypt, the hero of a romantic
episode, and the ethical judge of men in the Underworld. The
motif of the myth is the cosmic struggle between life and death;
the actors are made real persons, and the story is instinct with
human interest. No great cultic association like the Eleusinian
mysteries was created in connection with it, but the echo of the
conception appears in the great r&ocirc;le later assigned to Isis.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_959" id="p_959">959</a></b>. All Semitic myths of which we have records are cosmogonic
or sociologic or, in some late forms, theological constructions. It is
Babylonia that has furnished the greater part of the material, perhaps
all of it.<a name="FNanchor_1751" id="FNanchor_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> The stories preserved give little or no portraiture of
divine persons&mdash;it is always cosmic phenomena that are described,
and gods and heroes are introduced simply as actors. The purpose
in the two cosmogonic poems&mdash;to explain the reduction of the
world to order and the existing constitution of earth and sky&mdash;is
one that is found everywhere in ancient systems of thought. The
Gilgamesh epic, a collection of popular usages and tales without
definite unity, is contaminated with legend; Gilgamesh is now a
god, now a national hero; at the end, however, there is a bit of
speculation concerning the future state of men. Ishtar's descent
to the Underworld is a pure nature myth; Ishtar and the goddess
of the Underworld are real persons, yet merely attachments to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>fact. The seizure of the tablets of fate from Bel by the storm-god
Zu represents some natural phenomenon (perhaps the reign of
winter), possibly, also, a transference of headship from one deity
to another. The story of Adapa is in part an explanation of how
men came to lose immortality. There is, thus, in these myths a
fairly full history of the origin of the large facts of human life,
with little interest in the personalities of the divine actors.</p>

<p>Hebrew mythical material is in general identical with Babylonian;
its Old Testament form has been more or less revised by late monotheistic
editors. The two cosmogonies in Genesis, the flood story,
and the dragon of chaos (a late figure in the Old Testament<a name="FNanchor_1752" id="FNanchor_1752"></a><a href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">1752</a>) are
merely descriptions of cosmic or local facts. The dispersion at
Babel (not now found in Babylonian records, but paralleled elsewhere)
deals with a sociological fact of great interest for the
Hebrews, marking them off, as it did, from all other peoples.<a name="FNanchor_1753" id="FNanchor_1753"></a><a href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a>
The heroes of the early time<a name="FNanchor_1754" id="FNanchor_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> belong to folk-lore, probably a
mixture of myth and legend. The explanation of various human
experiences in the Eden story<a name="FNanchor_1755" id="FNanchor_1755"></a><a href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> appears to be of Hebrew origination;
it is, however, rather a late theological theory than a myth.
The Syrian and Palestinian Tammuz (Adonis) myth is identical in
general form with the Babylonian myth of Tammuz and Ishtar.<a name="FNanchor_1756" id="FNanchor_1756"></a><a href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">1756</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_960" id="p_960">960</a></b>. The Indo-European mythical material shows an advance
over the Egyptian and Semitic in distinctness and fullness of life
corresponding to the distincter individuality of the Indo-European
divine personages. These are not mere powers in the world, more
or less identified with natural forces and phenomena, nor a collection
of deities substantially identical in character and functions;

others.<a name="FNanchor_1757" id="FNanchor_1757"></a><a href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">1757</a> Indra, particularly, is portrayed in detail, so that he is as

As Zeus, Apollo, Athene, Aphrodite, and others are well-defined
personalities, each with certain intellectual and moral characteristics
and with a unity of development, so the stories about them recount
adventures and acts that form biographical unities; and, as these
stories are of diverse nature, some reflecting barbarous periods,
others marked by refinement, they exhibit, when brought together
and arranged in order of moral or intellectual excellence or according
to their geographical or ethnical origin, not only the history of
the gods, but also the development of Greek religious feeling. Being
the embodiment of human experiences, they lend themselves readily
to processes of allegorizing and spiritualizing.<a name="FNanchor_1758" id="FNanchor_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">1758</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_963" id="p_963">963</a></b>. Roman gods, homely figures, occupied with agriculture
and affairs of State, have no adventures and no biographies. The
practical Roman mind was concerned with the domestic functions
of divine beings, and the Roman genius was not of a sort to conceive
gods as individuals leading lives filled with human passions.
Myths do not figure in the Roman religious scheme except as they
are borrowed from Greece or from some other land.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_964" id="p_964">964</a></b>. Teutonic mythology is largely cosmogonic or cosmologic,

The great cosmogonic and eschatological myths are conceived in

<p>The history of theistic movements in civilized peoples shows that
the effectiveness of a polytheistic system as a framework of religious
life is in proportion to the extent of its anthropomorphization of
deities, that is, it is in proportion to their humanization that gods
enter into intimate association with human experiences. On the
other hand, it is true that the tendency toward a unitary conception
of the divine government of the world is in inverse proportion to
such humanization; the more definitely aloof from men the gods
have stood (as among the Hebrews and the Persians), the easier it
has been for the people to attach themselves to a single deity as
all-sufficient. The Romans form no exception to this general rule,
for though, while they did not create great anthropomorphic deities,
there was yet no native Roman movement toward monolatry, the
place of such deities in worship was taken by a multitude of minor
divine patrons who presided over all the details of private and
public life and satisfied the demand for divine guidance.</p>

<p>While polytheism has assumed various forms, differing from one
another in elaboration of deities and in general cultural character,
it has had, as a system, a distinctly marked place in human
experience.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_965" id="p_965">965</a></b>. <i>General r&ocirc;le of polytheism.</i> Polytheism has played a great
r&ocirc;le in the religious history of the world. Representing in general
a thoughtful protest against the earlier shapeless mass of spirits,
it expressed more definitely the belief in the intellectual and moral
divine control of all things. It flourished at a time when there
was no general demand in human thought for co&ouml;peration in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>supernatural Powers. The sense of variety in the world was predominant,
corresponding to the absence of co&ouml;peration among the
tribes and nations of the world; the apparently isolated character
of natural phenomena and the independence of the nations, each
of the others, seemed to men to demand a number of separate
divine agencies. These were all made to accord with the external
and internal condition of their worshipers and met the demands
of life in that they represented redemption, salvation, and, in general,
all blessings. They were not offensive ethically to the people
for the reason that they embodied the ethical conceptions and
usages of their time. Thus they furnished the framework for
religious feeling&mdash;they secured the union of divine and human in
life, brought the divine, indeed, into most intimate contact with the
human, and so supplied the material for the expression of pious
feeling. When the gods were represented by idols, these tended to
become merely the symbols and reminders of their divine originals.
The elastic character of this theistic system permitted the widest
variety of cults, with the possibility of bringing any new social
tendency or idea into immediate connection with a divine patron,
so that human life became religious with a degree of intelligence
and intensity that has perhaps not existed under any other system.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_966" id="p_966">966</a></b>. The great civilizations of the ancient world arose and were
developed under polytheism&mdash;many noble human characters and
customs and institutions were created under the dominance of this
system in Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and elsewhere&mdash;that
is to say, human instincts and aspirations developed freely under
a theistic organization that satisfied in general the intellectual and
moral needs of the time. The different polytheistic cults of the
world differed considerably in intellectual and moral value. These
differences pertain to the diversity of characteristics among the
nations of the world and are to be studied in connection with the
histories of the various peoples. Here it is sufficient to note
the general position which polytheism has occupied in the whole
religious development of the world.<a name="FNanchor_1762" id="FNanchor_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_967" id="p_967">967</a></b>. At a relatively early time, however, dissatisfaction arose
with the discordances of the polytheistic conception. It raised
many problems and failed to account for many phenomena, and
efforts were made to systematize and simplify the conceptions of
the divine government of the world. These efforts took the shape
of dualism, monotheism, pantheism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and
later tended to regard the supernatural in the world as Ultimate
Force or as Moral Ideal. These tendencies may be examined in
the order just given.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Dualism</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_968" id="p_968">968</a></b>. In all the religious systems so far considered the existence
of human suffering is assumed. The sole object of religious practices,
in all cults except the highest, has been to secure extrahuman
or superhuman aid and comfort in the ills of life. There has been
the conviction, for the most part implicit, that man is not in harmony
with his surroundings. We have now to consider those
systems of religious thought in which the existence of this disharmony
is more or less distinctly announced and the effort is made
to discover its source.</p>

<p>The conception of two sets of Powers in the world, one helpful
and the other harmful, is suggested by human experience and by
the larger observation of natural phenomena, and it is found all
over the world, among low communities as well as high, perhaps
in all tribes of men.<a name="FNanchor_1763" id="FNanchor_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a> Possibly there are some low groups, such as
the Fuegians and the African Pygmies in which the conception
does not exist; but as the religious ideas of these low groups are
yet imperfectly understood, we cannot say what their position on
this point is. In general, for the lower tribes the world is peopled
by spirits, which are the ghosts of the departed or the embodiment
of natural forces, and the feeling has been that these are sometimes
friendly, sometimes unfriendly.<a name="FNanchor_1764" id="FNanchor_1764"></a><a href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a> In some cases the hurtful
spirits stand in contrast with a god who may be a strict ruler
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>and somewhat indifferent to men, but not hostile; in other cases
there is a simple division of spirits into two classes, the friendly
and the unfriendly,<a name="FNanchor_1765" id="FNanchor_1765"></a><a href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a> and in the higher forms of savage life there
may be two such classes of deities.<a name="FNanchor_1766" id="FNanchor_1766"></a><a href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a> The double feeling of man
respecting the attitude of ghosts toward living human beings is
referred to above.<a name="FNanchor_1767" id="FNanchor_1767"></a><a href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_969" id="p_969">969</a></b>. In certain higher forms of savage and half-civilized life we
find the conception of a definite contrast between the two sets of
Powers. The Hottentots are said to believe in two opposed supernatural
beings, the struggle between them ending to the advantage
of the one who is beneficent toward men.<a name="FNanchor_1768" id="FNanchor_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> The Masai have two
powerful beings, one accounted good, the other bad; the difference
between them is not ethical, but represents only the relation of
their acts to man's well-being.<a name="FNanchor_1769" id="FNanchor_1769"></a><a href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a> The Malays have a very elaborate
system of good and evil spirits, but the system is colored by
foreign influences.<a name="FNanchor_1770" id="FNanchor_1770"></a><a href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a> For the Ainu snakes are an embodiment of
merely physical evil, and other Powers are the dispensers of physical
well-being.<a name="FNanchor_1771" id="FNanchor_1771"></a><a href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a> The Arab jinn represent the unwholesome and antagonistic
conditions of nature, stand opposed to the gods, and are
without ethical motives.<a name="FNanchor_1772" id="FNanchor_1772"></a><a href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> Even the Andamanese, one of the lowest
of human communities, have a division of Powers into one who is
friendly and two who are unfriendly.<a name="FNanchor_1773" id="FNanchor_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a> In all these cases we have
to recognize simply the expression of the perception of two sets
of physical agencies in the world. It is easy to exaggerate the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>nature of these contrasts and to represent certain low tribes as
possessing general divine embodiments of good and evil.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_970" id="p_970">970</a></b>. Such a conception has been attributed to the American
Redmen,<a name="FNanchor_1774" id="FNanchor_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a> but on insufficient grounds. The most careful recent
investigations of the religious ideas of the Creeks, the Len&acirc;p&eacute;, the
Pawnees, and the Californian Shasta (four typical communities)
fail to discover anything that can be called a real dualistic conception.<a name="FNanchor_1775" id="FNanchor_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a>
Dorsey mentions a Pawnee myth of the introduction of
death into the world by a member of the heavenly council of gods
who felt himself slighted; but this isolated story does not prove
the existence of a general dualistic scheme&mdash;the act in question
has parallels in savage systems that recognize various unfriendly
Powers.<a name="FNanchor_1776" id="FNanchor_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a> The reports we have of two definite morally antagonistic
deities in Redmen tribes resolve themselves on examination into
misconceptions or exaggerations on the part of the reporters; or,
so far as the antagonism really exists, it is due to Christian influence.
The Iroquois dualistic system as described by Chief Cusic
(in 1825)&mdash;two brothers, Good Mind and Bad Mind, the former
the creator of all things good, the latter the creator of all things
bad&mdash;appears in the version of Br&eacute;beuf (in 1636) as a simple
nature myth, the two deities in question being somewhat more
definite forms of the friendly and unfriendly spirits met with in all
lower communities.<a name="FNanchor_1777" id="FNanchor_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a> In like manner Winslow's two opposed
Powers of the New England Algonkins turn out not to be morally
antagonistic to each other, in fact, according to Brinton, not antagonistic
at all.<a name="FNanchor_1778" id="FNanchor_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a> These facts warn us to treat with caution the vague
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>statements of early travelers respecting dualistic views supposed
to be held by tribes in North America and South America.<a name="FNanchor_1779" id="FNanchor_1779"></a><a href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_971" id="p_971">971</a></b>. In West Africa the Ashanti embody the sources of physical
misfortune in several deities, who are malignant but do not
stand in opposition to the friendly gods. A preliminary step to the
conception of a god of misfortunes is the assignment of a sort
of headship to one of a mass of unfriendly or hurtful spirits&mdash;such
a crude organization is natural in a community in which there
is a fairly developed form of social organization, and the head
spirit easily grows into a god. A simple headship over hurtful
spirits appears to be found in the Ainu system, though this latter
is in general not well developed.<a name="FNanchor_1780" id="FNanchor_1780"></a><a href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_972" id="p_972">972</a></b>. A definite antagonism of good and bad Powers is found
in the religion of the non-Aryan Khonds of Orissa: the earth-goddess
Tari, the creature but the opponent of the sun-god Bella
Pennu, introduced sin and death into the world and contested (and,
according to one native account, still contests) with her creator the
control of life. This explanation of the origin of death is a higher
form of stories that occur abundantly in savage lore, with the important
difference that in these death comes by accident, but here
by malicious purpose. It is not clear whether or not the characters
of Tari and Bella Pennu are conceived of ethically. The weapons
(comets, winds, mountains) employed by the two deities indicate
that the basis of the representation is a nature myth. Advanced
eschatological thought appears in the opinion, held by some natives,
that the good god was victorious in the contest.<a name="FNanchor_1781" id="FNanchor_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_973" id="p_973">973</a></b>. In the great ancient religions, with the exception of Zoroastrianism,
no dualistic scheme appears. An Egyptian god may be
angry, as, for example, Ra, who in a fit of resentment causes men
to be slain but soon repents; and Set, the enemy of Osiris, a
nature god, seemed at one time to be on the way to become an
embodiment of evil, but the Egyptian cult rejected this idea and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>Set gradually disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_1782" id="FNanchor_1782"></a><a href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">1782</a> The Babylonian cosmogonic myth, in
which Tiamat is the enemy of the gods of order, has no cultic
significance; the great mass of demonic beings was not organized
into a kingdom of evil, and the Underworld deities, nature gods,
while subject to ordinary human passions, are not hostile to the gods
of heaven and earth. The Hebrews adopted the Babylonian cosmogonic
myth,<a name="FNanchor_1783" id="FNanchor_1783"></a><a href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a> but it became a mere literary attachment to the conception
of the supreme god Yahweh, and was otherwise ineffective.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_974" id="p_974">974</a></b>. The same thing is true of certain cosmogonic myths of
the Greeks, such as the war of the Titans against Zeus and similar
episodes. Ate and the Erinyes are embodiments of man's own evil
nature or represent the punishment that overtakes guilt, but they
do not represent a formal opposition to goodness nor are they
organized into a definite body.<a name="FNanchor_1784" id="FNanchor_1784"></a><a href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">1784</a> The Roman Furies are practically
identical in function with the Erinyes. In the old Teutonic religion
the only figure who approaches essential badness is Loki; but he,
though at times malignant and treacherous (as a human chieftain
might be), remains a recognized member of the assembly of gods.
As a nature god he may represent the elements of darkness and
unhappiness in life, just as the various evil spirits in the world do,
but he never approaches the position of an independent creator of
evil.<a name="FNanchor_1785" id="FNanchor_1785"></a><a href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">1785</a> The Celtic deities Llew and Dylan are said to stand over
against each other and to represent good and bad tendencies and
elements of life; but they are not very distinct and are probably
nothing more than somewhat developed local deities.<a name="FNanchor_1786" id="FNanchor_1786"></a><a href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">1786</a> In the Chinese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>and Japanese cults there is no indication of a conflict; evil spirits
there are in abundance, but no cosmic antagonism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_975" id="p_975">975</a></b>. In India the cosmogonic myths are to be interpreted in
the same way as those mentioned above. Soma and Indra, as
slayers of the demon Vritya, represent order as against disorder,
but Vritya never had cultic significance; he appears only as a
bodily demonstration of the power of the great gods. The asuras
are not essentially different from the harmful spirits of savages,
though it is true that they come into conflict with the friendly gods.
Rahu, who causes eclipses by swallowing the sun, is only a nature
deity of great might. In the Mahabharata there are powerful
demons, and the &Ccedil;ivaite cult includes the worship of dread beings,
but such worship only reflects the fear of the unfriendly elements
of physical nature.<a name="FNanchor_1787" id="FNanchor_1787"></a><a href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">1787</a> Nor do we find in the persons of Durga, Kali,
and the Yakshas, unpleasantly savage as these are, a conception of
evil as an organized force directed against the good gods; they
are rather the embodiment of evil human dispositions. The underground
demons are punishers of sin, but not themselves morally
evil. There is, it is true, in the Hindu religious scheme the general
antithesis of light and darkness, which are connected with right
and wrong&mdash;an antithesis that appears abundantly in other religious
systems;<a name="FNanchor_1788" id="FNanchor_1788"></a><a href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">1788</a> but the powers of darkness are not organized
against the powers of light, and there is no complete dualism,
though we have here, perhaps, the starting-point for such a
conception.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_976" id="p_976">976</a></b>. While thus a vague sense of duality has existed all over
the world, and in certain cases, as it seems, there were vague
attempts at organization, it is only in Zoroastrianism that the decisive
step has been taken. We have to recognize in this system a
distinct movement towards a unitary conception of the world; but
the sense of difference in human experiences was so great in the
mind of the creators of the system that they were led to a unification
in two divisions.<a name="FNanchor_1789" id="FNanchor_1789"></a><a href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">1789</a> The origin of the movement lies far back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>at a time when there were no records of thought and social movements,
and it is impossible now to say definitely what were the
original elements of the cult. We may surmise that there was an
Indo-Iranian conception of a general contrast between light and
darkness, and that this was the starting-point or the basis of the
developed Iranian theological system. The old Indic and the old
Iranian religions seem to have been independent developments
from a common original mass of material; but we do not know
what determined the differences in the two developments. The
constructions were the work, doubtless, of successions of reformers,
but the details of these long-continued efforts have not come down
to us.<a name="FNanchor_1790" id="FNanchor_1790"></a><a href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">1790</a> The essential point is that the evil mass in the world was
conceived of as a unity by the Iranians and assigned a head, Angro
Mainyu. This name does not occur in the Ach&aelig;menian inscriptions,
but it is mentioned in the Gathas and by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_1791" id="FNanchor_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a> so that
it appears to belong to an early stratum of the Iranian religion.
The present state of the world is regarded as the result of a constant
series of antagonisms between the two creators, Spenta Mainyu
(Ahura Mazda) and Angro Mainyu, these being attended each by a
circle of helpers. A polytheistic interpretation of the helpers is
avoided by making them abstractions (though with a tendency
toward personification), the representatives of various features or
elements in the government of the world or in the experiences
of men.<a name="FNanchor_1792" id="FNanchor_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_977" id="p_977">977</a></b>. A strictly dualistic system recognizes only two Powers in
the world. The Avestan religion, however, admits other deities
besides Ahura Mazda and Angro Mainyu; Mitra, Anahita, and
others are objects of worship. The ancient national faiths, that is,
were not content with a simple division of things between two
divine beings. An approach to such a view was made by Judaism,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>which, partly under Persian influence, produced the figure of the
Satan, a quasi-independent being hostile to the Supreme Deity.<a name="FNanchor_1793" id="FNanchor_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">1793</a>
Christianity, adopting this conception from Judaism, elaborated it
into the person of the Devil, the veritable head of a kingdom of
evil, called in the New Testament "the god of this age."<a name="FNanchor_1794" id="FNanchor_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">1794</a> Though
doomed to final defeat, as Ahriman in the Avesta is doomed, the
Devil in the orthodox Christian system is practically omnipresent
and is powerful enough to defeat the plans of God in many cases.
In modern enlightened Christian feeling, however, he has become
little more than a name. Though he is credited in theory with
suggesting evil and alluring men to sin, this dogma has small force
in the better minds against the strong conviction of individual freedom
and responsibility. Current Christianity, in its highest forms,
is theoretically, but not really, dualistic. The Satan is taken more
seriously by Islam, which has adopted the conception from Christianity
and Judaism.<a name="FNanchor_1795" id="FNanchor_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">1795</a> For the ordinary Moslem he belongs in the
category of evil spirits and is as real as one of the jinn; he may
be cursed and stoned and driven away,<a name="FNanchor_1796" id="FNanchor_1796"></a><a href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">1796</a> but he does not affect
the Moslem belief in the oneness of God.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_978" id="p_978">978</a></b>. From the conquest of Persia by Alexander to the fall of
the Parthian dynasty (a period of over five hundred years) little is
known of the history of Mazdaism beyond the fact that it seems to
have been adopted by the Parthians in a debased form; but about
the time of the Persian revival under the Sassanians (226 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) it
passed the bounds of its native land and made its way into the
Roman Empire in the shape of Manich&aelig;ism, a mixture of dualistic
and Christian Gnostic conceptions. That Manich&aelig;ism had a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>force is shown by the fact that it attracted such a man as Augustine,
and its survival for several centuries in spite of persecutions attests
its vitality. It may be doubted whether its attractiveness lay so
much in its dualism as in its gnosticism, though the former element
maintained itself in some minor Christian sects. However this may
be, it gradually faded away, leaving no lasting impression; it was
a form of faith not suited to the peoples who professed Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_1797" id="FNanchor_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">1797</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_979" id="p_979">979</a></b>. The modern philosophic proposals to recognize two deities
instead of one are as yet too vague to call for discussion. Dualism,
though it accounts in some fashion for the twofold character of
human experiences, raises as many problems as it solves; in particular
it finds itself confronted apparently by a physical and psychological
unity in the world which it is hard to explain on the
hypothesis of conflicting supernatural Powers.<a name="FNanchor_1798" id="FNanchor_1798"></a><a href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a> On the moral side
the record of dualistic schemes is in general good. The ethical
standard of Mazdaism is high, and the ethical practice of Mazdean
communities hardly differs from that of other prominent modern
religious bodies. Though the Manich&aelig;ans were accused of immoral
practices, it does not appear that Mani himself or any prominent
disciple of his announced or favored or permitted such practices.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Monotheism</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_980" id="p_980">980</a></b>. The preceding survey has shown that the theory of dualism
has not proved in general acceptable to men. It was adopted by
one people only, and even by them not in complete form, and its
character as a national cult was destroyed by the Moslem conquest
of Persia in the seventh century. The Zoroastrian system was
indeed carried by a body of emigrants to India and has since
been professed by the Parsis there; but it has been converted by
them into a practical monotheistic cult, so that a consistent dualism
now exists nowhere in the world. The thought of the great
civilized nations has turned rather to a unitary view of the divine
government of the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span><b><a name="p_981" id="p_981">981</a></b>. The history of the movement which has elevated monotheism
to the highest place among the civilized cults extends over
the whole period of man's life on the earth. It is pointed out above<a name="FNanchor_1799" id="FNanchor_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a>
that very generally in low tribes a local supernatural personage is
invested with great power: he is creator, ruler, and guardian of
morals; where a tolerably definite civil and political organization
exists he has virtually the position and performs the functions of
the tribal chief, only with vastly greater powers and privileges;
where there is no such organization he is simply a vaguely conceived,
mysterious man who has control of the elements and of
human fortunes, and punishes violations of tribal custom. Such a
personage is, however, at best only the highest among many supernatural
Powers. It is immaterial whether we regard such a figure
as developed from a spirit or as the direct product of religious
imagination. He is always crudely anthropomorphic and, notwithstanding
his primacy, is limited in power by his own nature, by
other supernatural Powers, and by men. Frequently, also, he tends
to become otiose and virtually loses his supremacy;<a name="FNanchor_1800" id="FNanchor_1800"></a><a href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a> that is to say,
in the increased complexity of social life a god who was once sufficient
for the needs of a simpler organization has to give way to
a number of Powers which are regarded as the controllers of special
departments of life. Such an otiose form may sometimes indicate
a succession of divine quasi-dynasties, somewhat as in the Greek
sequence of Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus. Handed down from a former
generation, he becomes dim and is neglected. That he is not worshiped
is a result of the fact that other divine beings, standing
nearer to existing human interests, have come to the front.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_982" id="p_982">982</a></b>. The theory has been held in the past, and is still held, that
monotheism was the primitive form of religion and that the worship
of many spirits or many gods is a corruption of primitive
thought due to man's intellectual feebleness or to his moral depravity.
It is urged that such a monotheistic system was the
natural one for unsophisticated man. The view has been widely
held also that it was the result of a primitive divine revelation to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>men. It is obvious that neither of these opinions is susceptible of
proof on a priori grounds; the question can be settled only by a
survey of the phenomena known to us. When the facts are clearly
stated, it is then allowable to deduce from them such conclusions
as may seem legitimate.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_983" id="p_983">983</a></b>. As a matter of fact, it does not appear that real monotheistic
belief exists or has existed among savage and half-civilized
communities of whose history we have any knowledge. Where a
certain supernatural being is described by observers as "the god"
or "the supreme god" of a tribe, it turns out on inquiry that he
is at most, as is remarked above, a very prominent divine figure,
perhaps the most prominent, but never standing alone and never
invested with those physical, intellectual, and moral capacities that
are necessary for a complete monotheistic faith.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_984" id="p_984">984</a></b>. While, however, this conclusion is generally admitted for
the majority of cases,<a name="FNanchor_1801" id="FNanchor_1801"></a><a href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a> it has been held, and is still held, that there
are found in savage cults certain "self-existent, eternal, moral"
beings who satisfy all the conditions of a monotheistic faith. Among
the examples cited are the American gods described by Strachey
and Winslow as supreme in power and ethically good.<a name="FNanchor_1802" id="FNanchor_1802"></a><a href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a> But, even
in the curt and vague accounts of these early observers (who were
not in position to get accurate notions of Indian beliefs), it appears
that there were many gods, the supposed supreme deity being
simply the most prominent in the regions known to the first settlers.
The "Great Spirit" of the Jesuit missionaries is found, in like
manner, to be one of many supernatural patrons, locally important
but not absolute in power.<a name="FNanchor_1803" id="FNanchor_1803"></a><a href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">1803</a> The Zulu Unkulunkulu is revered by
the natives as a very great being, morally good according to the
standards of the people, but he is of uncertain origin and is valueless
in the existing cult.<a name="FNanchor_1804" id="FNanchor_1804"></a><a href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">1804</a> The much-discussed Australian figures,
Baiame, Bunjil, and Daramulun, appear not to differ essentially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>from those just mentioned. The reports of the natives who have
been questioned on the subject are often vague and sometimes
mutually contradictory, and exact biographical details of these
divine personages are lacking; but careful recent observers are
of opinion that they are nothing more than supernatural headmen,
having such power as tribal chiefs or headmen possess, and credited
in different regions with different moral qualities.<a name="FNanchor_1805" id="FNanchor_1805"></a><a href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">1805</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_985" id="p_985">985</a></b>. In the systems of many other low tribes there are quasi-divine
beings who are credited with great power and are revered
without being thought of as eternal or as standing alone in the
government of the world. A specially interesting example is the
Andaman Puluga, a sort of creator who receives no worship; his
abode is a mountain or the sky, and he seems to have been originally
a local supernatural figure who is traditionally respected but
is no longer thought of as an efficient patron.<a name="FNanchor_1806" id="FNanchor_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a> The mysterious
Ndengei of Fiji is judge of the dead, but one of many gods and
not all-powerful.<a name="FNanchor_1807" id="FNanchor_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a> In many tribes there is no one great divine
figure; the control of things is divided among hosts of spirits and
gods. This is the case with the Ainu, the Maoris, the Greenlanders,
the Kwakiutl of Northwest America,<a name="FNanchor_1808" id="FNanchor_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> and is probably the rule in
most of the lower communities.</p>

<p>The terms 'self-existent' and 'eternal' are not found in savage
vocabularies and seem to have no representatives in savage thought.
Savage cosmology carries the history of the world back to a certain
point and stops when there is no familiar hypothesis of genesis.<a name="FNanchor_1809" id="FNanchor_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a>
As a rule spirits (as distinguished from ghosts) are not thought of
as having a creator; they are a part of the system of things and
are not supposed to need explanation, and so it seems to be with
simple clan gods. Nor is there any reason, in savage theory, why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>gods or spirits should die; death is an accident for human beings,
not an essential feature of their constitution; but such an accident
is not usually supposed to occur in the case of gods. What takes
the place of the conception of 'eternal' in savage thought is an
existence that is supposed to continue for the reason that its cessation
does not come into consideration. As to creation, there is no
need, in a low community, to suppose more than one originator of
the world, and cosmogonic theory may stop at that point, though
this is not an invariable rule. The title "father" for persons of
distinction, human or divine, is found among many undeveloped
peoples, and a headman or patron may be called, by a natural
extension of thought, "all-father," a title that is not essentially
different in signification from the simple "father," and does not
carry with it the refined sense of later times. The question of
savage monotheism need present no difficulty if the conditions are
clearly defined.<a name="FNanchor_1810" id="FNanchor_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a> It is true that there is in some cases a monarchical
conception of the divine control of a clan or a tribe, and that
this simple system is followed by a more or less elaborate theology.
In both civil and religious systems the increasing complexity of
social life has called forth correspondingly complex organizations,
but this movement away from simplicity does not denote falling off
in civil and religious purity and wisdom. A true monotheism has
never arisen except as a criticism of polytheism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_986" id="p_986">986</a></b>. It is obvious that the popular cults of the great nations of
antiquity were far removed from monotheism. The Egyptians, the
Babylonians and the Assyrians, the Ph&oelig;nicians, the Hebrews, the
Arabs, the Hindus, the Greeks and the Romans, down to a late
period, worshiped a multitude of gods and were not disturbed by
any feeling of lack of unity in the divine government of the world.
The proof that such was the case among the ancient Hebrews down
to the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> is found in the Old Testament writings:
the historical books from the entrance of the Hebrew tribes into
Canaan down to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>and the prophetical writings of the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries
represent the people generally as addicted to the worship of
a great number of gods. In Persia also, since the Mazdean system
recognized a considerable number of deities, it cannot be doubted
that the people were polytheistic, not to speak of the probability
that there were survivals of a lower form of religion which preceded
Mazdaism. In the modern nations of the east of Asia, China and
Japan, the popular worship is anything but monotheistic: in China
the local spirits play a very great part in the life of the people, and
in Japan the old gods are still objects of worship. It may be added
that among the masses in some nominally Christian countries,
particularly among the peasants of Southern Europe, the old polytheism
continues in the form of the worship of saints and the
Madonna.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_987" id="p_987">987</a></b>. While the popular cults in the civilized world have held
somewhat pertinaciously to pluralistic views, there has been a
general tendency in advanced circles everywhere toward a unitary
conception of the government of the world. As this tendency has
been general it must be referred to the general progress of thought,
the demand of the human mind for unity or simplicity. The particular
lines of the movement have varied among different peoples
according to the peculiarities of their culture, and the unitary feeling
has varied in its degree of definiteness. In some cases the political
predominance of a city or region has secured pre&euml;minence for its
deity, or national attachment to the national god has elevated him
above all other gods; where a people has cultivated poetry or
philosophy, the idealizing thought of the one or the scientific
analysis of the other has led in the same direction.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_988" id="p_988">988</a></b>. First, then, we may note the disposition to give substantial
absoluteness to some one god, the choice of the deity being determined
by the political condition as is suggested above, or by local
attachments, or possibly by other conditions which do not appear
in the meager records of early times. Examples of this form of
thought are found in several of the great nations of antiquity. The
hymns to the Egyptian gods Ra, Amon, Amon-Ra, Osiris, and the
Nile describe these deities as universal in attributes and in power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
At the moment the poet conceives of the god whom he celebrates
as practically the only one&mdash;if Ra does everything, there is no
need of any other deity. At another moment, however, the same
poet may celebrate Osiris with equal enthusiasm&mdash;these high gods
are interchangeable. The suggestion from such fluid conceptions
of the divine persons is that the real thought in the mind of the
poet was the supremacy of some divine power which is incorporated
now in one familiar divine name, now in another. It does
not, however, quite reach the point of well-defined monotheism,
for these gods remain distinct, sometimes with separate functions
and duties.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_989" id="p_989">989</a></b>. But this mode of conceiving of the supernatural Power
would naturally pave the way for monotheism, and it is not surprising
that very early in Egypt a definite monotheistic view was
developed. King Amenophis IV, or to give him the name that he
adopted in conformity with his later cult, Khuen-Aten, made a
deliberate attempt to elevate the sun-god Aten to the position of
sole ruler and object of worship. Though the nature of his belief
in this deity is not stated in the documents with the fullness and
precision that we should desire, it seems clear, from the fact that
he ordered the destruction of the shrines of the other deities in the
land, that he regarded the worship of this one god as sufficient.
The movement was not a successful one in so far as the national
religion was concerned&mdash;it lasted only during his lifetime and that
of his son, and then a counter-revolution swept Aten away and
reinstated the Theban Amon in all his former dignity and powers&mdash;but
its very existence is a testimony to the direction of thought
of educated minds in Egypt about the year 1400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The Aten
revolution appears to have been distinctively Egyptian&mdash;there is
no trace of foreign influence in its construction. It has been suggested
that Amenophis got his idea from Semites of Western Asia
or particularly from the Hebrews. But neither the Hebrews nor
any other Semitic people of that period were monotheistic, nor do
we find in Egyptian history at the time such social intercourse as
might produce a violent upturning of the religious usage. We can
only suppose that Amenophis was a religious genius who put into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
definite shape a conception that was in the air, and by the force of
his enthusiasm made it for the moment effective. Such geniuses
have arisen from time to time in the world, and though the revolution
of this Egyptian king may seem to us to have sprung up with
abnormal abruptness, it is more reasonable to suppose that the way
had been prepared for it in Egyptian thought. He was a man
born out of due time; but it cannot be said that his attempt was
without influence on succeeding generations.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_990" id="p_990">990</a></b>. Passing now to the oldest Semitic civilizations, we find in
Babylonia and Assyria many local deities, one or another of whom
comes to the front under the hegemony of some city or state. Here
we are met by the fact already referred to that the gods are interchangeable&mdash;it
is practically a matter of indifference whether one
deity or another is elevated to headship. In the great empires the
gods of the capital cities naturally became pre&euml;minent; so Marduk
in Babylonia and Ashur in Assyria. The royal inscriptions speak
of these gods as if they were all-powerful and all-controlling. In
both countries the goddess Ishtar appears as the supreme director
of affairs, and other deities are similarly honored. What might
have been the issue if the later Babylonian kingdom had continued
for a long time it is impossible to say, but the impression made by
the words of the devout king Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) is
that he would have been content with Marduk as the one object
of worship. Babylonia produced no such radical reformer as the
Egyptian Amenophis&mdash;there is no formulation of monotheism;
but the general tone of the Babylonian religion of the sixth century
is not very different from that of the Hebrew religion of the
same time.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_991" id="p_991">991</a></b>. The religious point of view of the Vedas belongs in the
same category with the early Egyptian. Varuna, Agni, and Indra
appear in the hymns, each in his turn, as supreme. The r&ocirc;le of
Varuna seems to be practically identical with that of the Iranian
Ahura, but unlike the latter he does not succeed in expelling his
brother divinities. This difference of development between the
Hindu and the Iranian people we cannot hope to explain. India
moved not toward monotheism, but toward pantheism. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Vedic hymns prove the existence of a certain sense of oneness in
the world, held by the poets, though not by the mass of the people,
and destined to issue in a very remarkable religious system.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_992" id="p_992">992</a></b>. It has been by a very different line that China has reached
its unitary conception of the world. The details of the movement
are obscure, but its general course is clear.<a name="FNanchor_1811" id="FNanchor_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">1811</a> As with many other
peoples it is the objects of nature to which Chinese worship is
mainly paid, but the Chinese mind, impressed by the power of
these objects, is content to rest in them in their visible form; no
proper names are attached to them, and they have a more or less
vague personality which varies in definiteness at different times
and with different persons. The theistic system is a reflection of the
social system. The eminently practical Chinese mind lays the chief
stress on the earthly life: in the common everyday life the family
is the unit; but the general course of affairs is controlled by the
great natural Powers of earth and sky, whence arise the two great
divisions of Chinese worship. The State is a larger family in
which the duke or emperor or other chief political officer occupies
the same position that is occupied by the father in the smaller
social circle; the government is patriarchal, with gradations which
correspond to those of the family. Life, it is held, is controlled by
the heavenly bodies, by the mountains and rivers of the earth, and
by deceased members of families. To these the people sacrifice,
the principal part being taken by the civil heads of the larger and
smaller constituent parts of the empire; there is thus no place for
priests. As the emperor (or other head of the State) is supreme
on earth, so Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon occupy the highest
positions in the divine hierarchy, and ancestors are influential and
entitled to worship according to the rank of the families they
represent.<a name="FNanchor_1812" id="FNanchor_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a> From an early time, long before Confucius, the headship
of the divine Powers, it would seem, was assigned to Heaven&mdash;not
the physical sky, but, at least in the thinking circles of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>nation, the Power therein residing. Thus arose the conception
of an imperial divine government in which Heaven, though it does
not stand alone, is recognized as supreme. The larger theistic
conception is embodied in the annual sacrifices conducted by the
emperor,<a name="FNanchor_1813" id="FNanchor_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a> especially at the winter and summer solstices when sacrifices
are offered to Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, the Four
Quarters and the mountains and rivers of the empire and to his
ancestors, whose worship includes the interests of the whole State.
Thus with a vast number of objects of worship (spirits of all departments
of life, and a few gods proper) the Chinese religion has
attained and maintained a general unitary conception of the
divine government of the world.<a name="FNanchor_1814" id="FNanchor_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_993" id="p_993">993</a></b>. Some resemblance to the Chinese system appears in the
religion of Peru, so far as this can be understood from the accounts
that have come down to us.<a name="FNanchor_1815" id="FNanchor_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a> The supreme position given to the
Sun in Peru and to the Inca as child of the Sun is parallel to the
supremacy of Heaven in China and the headship of the emperor
as the son of Heaven. The Peruvian cult appears not to have
reached the distinctness of the Chinese. There were, in fact, in
Peru a considerable number of tolerably well-formed divinities
along with a vast crowd of spirits. Yet it appears that the sun
was regarded, at least by the Inca and his circle, as supreme ruler
of the world. The Sun, as god, has no proper name in Peru, as
in China Heaven, as god, has no proper name. In both countries,
it would seem, the imagination of the people was overpowered by
the spectacle of the majesty of a great natural object. The two
religions differ in their ritual development: while the Inca, like
the Chinese emperor, was the religious head of the nation, the
Peruvians created an elaborate system of worship, with temples
and ministrants, which is wanting in China.<a name="FNanchor_1816" id="FNanchor_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a> The remarkable
character of the Peruvian system makes it all the more regrettable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>that the data available do not enable us to trace its growth from
the simplest beginnings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_994" id="p_994">994</a></b>. Still another line of theistic development is furnished by
the Hebrew system. The Hebrews are remarkable among ancient
peoples as having had, so far as our information goes, only one
national god. This god they brought with them into Canaan from
the wilderness over which they appear to have roamed with their
flocks for a period and under conditions not definitely known to
us. Arrived in Canaan, the masses were attracted by the local
Canaanite deities (whose worship represented a higher civilization
than that of the nomadic Hebrews), and later, in the seventh century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, a great part of the people of the little kingdom of Judah
adopted the Assyrian astral cult; but a group of Israelites had
always remained faithful to the national deity Yahweh (Jehovah)
and vigorously opposed all foreign worship. It was naturally the
more thoughtful and ethically better-developed part of the community
that took this uncompromising position, and their spokesmen,
the writing prophets whose discourses are preserved in the
Old Testament, became preachers of morality as well as champions
of the sole worship of Yahweh. It does not appear that they denied
the existence of other gods, but they regarded their own god as
superior to all others in power, standing in a peculiarly close relation
to his people and bound to them by peculiarly intimate ties.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_995" id="p_995">995</a></b>. This attachment to one deity proved to be the dominant
sentiment of the nation. As time went on and the people were
sifted by the Assyrian and Babylonian deportations, the higher
moral feeling of the best men attached itself more and more definitely
to the national god. Thus was established a monolatry
which was practically monotheism, though a theory of absolute
monotheism was never formulated by the pre-Christian Jews. It
must be added, as is remarked above, that, from the third or
second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> on, the somewhat undefined range of activity
attributed to Satan produced a sort of dualism, yet without impairing
the practically unitary conception of the divine government
of the world.<a name="FNanchor_1817" id="FNanchor_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a> The course of their national fortunes and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>remarkable power of self-contained persistence of the Jews brought
about a segregation of the people and, finally, their organization
into a community governed by a law held to be divinely revealed.
This capacity of social religious organization was the distinctive
characteristic of the Jewish people and, supported by their unitary
theistic system and a high moral code, gave the example of popular
monotheism which, through the medium of Christianity, finally
imposed itself upon the Roman world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_996" id="p_996">996</a></b>. In the ancient world the most thorough investigation of the
theistic problem was made by the Greeks, whose leading thinkers,
like the Hebrews, moved steadily toward a unitary conception of
the divine power, but, unlike the Hebrews, did not succeed in
impressing their views on the people at large. What the theistic
conception in the pre-Homeric times was we are unable to say
definitely, but presumably in every separate community there was
a local deity who had practically the direction of affairs. In process
of time, through conditions not known to us, Zeus came to be recognized
throughout the Hellenic world as the principal deity. In
the Homeric poems and in Hesiod we find a political or governmental
organization of the gods which followed the lines of the social
organization of the times. As Agamemnon is the head chief over a
group of local chiefs, so Zeus, though not absolutely supreme, is a
divine king, the head over a considerable number of deities who
have their own preferences and plans, and in ordinary matters go
their own way and are not interfered with so long as they mind
their own business; but at critical points Zeus, like Agamemnon,
intervenes, and then no god disputes his decisions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_997" id="p_997">997</a></b>. This conception of the divine government appears, therefore,
to rest on the Greek demand for political organization; the
world was thought of as divided into various departments which
had to be brought into a unity by the ascription of a quasi-supreme
authority to some one personage. Necessarily, however, larger intellectual
and ethical ideas were incorporated in this political view.
Though the popular anthropomorphic conceptions of the deities
appear throughout the Homeric poems (the gods being sometimes
morally low as well as limited in knowledge and power), yet on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
other hand they are said to know everything. To Zeus in particular
lofty qualities are ascribed; he is the father of men and their savior
and the patron of justice. How it came about that these two sorts
of conceptions of a supreme deity are mingled in the poems is a
question that need not be discussed here; a similar mingling of
contradictory ideas is found in the Old Testament, in which the
unmoral god of the people stands alongside of the highly developed
ethical Yahweh of the great prophets.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_998" id="p_998">998</a></b>. In Homer and Hesiod, however, the conception of headship
is complicated by the introduction of the idea of fate. In the
Iliad Zeus is sometimes ignorant of the future and has to employ
the scales of destiny, and in Hesiod appear the three Fates who
control the lives of men independently of the gods. The conception
of a controlling fate may be regarded as an effort to reach an absolutely
unitary view of the world. Above all the divine powers that
regulate affairs, after the manner of the government by a king with
his attendant chieftains and officers, there is a sense of a dim and
undefined power of unknown origin, mysterious, absolute, universal.
The question whether this conception was a reflection of a sense of
the controlling power resident in the universe itself, or merely an
endeavor to rise above the variations of anthropomorphic deities,
is important from the point of view of the genesis of ideas, but
its decision will not affect the fact just stated.<a name="FNanchor_1818" id="FNanchor_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a> Obviously in the
Homeric world there appears this general conviction that men and
gods are bound together in unity and that some force or power
controls all things.<a name="FNanchor_1819" id="FNanchor_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_999" id="p_999">999</a></b>. This sense of the governmental unity is further developed
by the later great poets who infused into it higher and more definite
moral elements. The polytheistic view continues; to the thinkers
of the time there was no more difficulty in conceiving of a single
headship along with many deities of particular functions than was
felt by Hebrew prophets who recognized the existence of foreign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>deities, with Yahweh as a superior god, or by the modern Christian
world with its apparatus of angels, saints, and demons alongside
of the supreme God. For Pindar Zeus is lord of all things
and is far removed from the moral impurities of the popular conception.
&AElig;schylus represents him as supreme and in general as
just, though not wholly free from human weaknesses. A real
unity of the world is set forth by Sophocles: there is a divinely
ordered control by immutable law, and the will of Zeus is unquestioned.
The unitary conception is found also in Euripides notwithstanding
his skeptical attitude toward the current mythology.
The sense of symmetry potent in the poets forced them to this
unitary conception of government, and the natural progress of
ethical feeling led them to ascribe the highest ethical qualities to
the deities.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1000" id="p_1000">1000</a></b>. Similar motives appear in the speculations of the Greek
philosophers: Greek philosophy in seeking to discover the essential
nature of the world moved definitely toward the conception of its
unity&mdash;so, for example, as early as the sixth century, in Xenophanes
and Parmenides. The conception of a supreme spiritual
ruler of the world appears in Heraclitus and Anaxagoras (fifth
century). To these and other Greek thinkers the unity of the
world and the dominance of mind or spirit appeared to be necessary
assumptions. The most definite expression of these conceptions
is found in Plato and Aristotle. According to Plato (in the
Tim&aelig;us) God, the eternal Father, created the world (for nothing
can be created without a cause), brought order out of disorder and
made the universe to be most fair and good, so that it became a
rational living soul, the one only-begotten universe, created the gods
and the sons of the gods, and framed the soul to be the ruler of the
body. Aristotle, in simpler phrase, represents the ground of the
world as self-sufficient Mind, an eternal Power (&#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;), from which
all action or actuality (&#7952;&#957;&#8051;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;) proceeds.<a name="FNanchor_1820" id="FNanchor_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1001" id="p_1001">1001</a></b>. There are certain apparent limitations, it is true, to this
conception of unity. Both Plato and Aristotle recognize the existence
of a host of subordinate deities (created but immortal) to whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>is assigned a share, by direction of the supreme God, in the creation
of things; yet essentially these deities are nothing more than agents
or intermediaries of the divine activity, and may be compared to
the natural laws and agents of modern theism and, more exactly,
to the Hebrew angels through whom, according to the Old Testament,
God governed the world. Plato has also a somewhat vague
notion of a something in the nature of the material of the world
that limits or constrains the divine creative power&mdash;a "necessity"
that forces the deity to do not the absolutely best but the best
possible. Perhaps this is a philosophical formulation of the old
"fate," perhaps Plato is merely trying to account for certain supposed
inconcinnities and inadequacies in the world. He is not quite
consistent with himself, since he represents the creation of the
universe as resulting from the fact that necessity yielded to the
persuasion of mind, which thus became supreme.<a name="FNanchor_1821" id="FNanchor_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> In spite of this
vagueness his view is unitary, and the unitary conception is continued
by the Stoics, its best Stoic expression being found in the
famous hymn of Cleanthes to Zeus: "Nothing occurs on earth
apart from thee" and "We are thy offspring."<a name="FNanchor_1822" id="FNanchor_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1002" id="p_1002">1002</a></b>. In the last centuries before the beginning of our era the
Jews, partly under Persian and Greek influence, clarified their
theistic view, attaining a practically pure monotheism, only retaining
their apparatus of angels and demons. This theistic scheme
passed over in complete form to early Christianity, in which, however,
greater prominence was given to the chief demon, the Satan;
his larger r&ocirc;le arose from the fact that he was brought into sharp
antagonism with the Christ, the head of the kingdom of God.
When Christianity was adopted by the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world, the
doctrine of the Trinity was worked out and formulated in accordance
with Greek and Roman philosophic thought, but was held
not to impair the monotheistic view since the three Persons were
regarded as being in substance one. Islam adopted the Jewish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>form of monotheism, with its Satan and angels, retaining also the
old Arabian apparatus of demonic beings (the jinn).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1003" id="p_1003">1003</a></b>. A certain tendency to a practically unitary view is discernible
in the cults of Isis and Mithra, which were widely diffused in
the Roman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_1823" id="FNanchor_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a> In both these cults the main interest of the
worshipers was centered in a single deity, though other deities were
recognized. The unifying impulse was devotional, not philosophic.</p>

<p>So far as a unitary conception of the divine government of the
world existed it must be referred to the spirit of the age which had
outgrown the old crude polytheism. Such modern monotheistic
movements as the Brahma-Samaj and the Parsi in India, the
Babist in Persia, and the reformed Shinto in Japan owe much to
European influence, though doubtless some part of them is the
outcome of natural progress in intellectual and moral conceptions.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Pantheistic and Nontheistic Systems</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1004" id="p_1004">1004</a></b>. The systems of theistic thought considered above all
make a sharp separation between God and the world. Plato and
Aristotle regarded mind or spirit as a force that dominated matter.
The Persian, Hebrew, and Christian theologies conceive of the
deity as transcendent, standing outside of and above the world
and entering into communication with it either by direct revelation
or through intermediaries. To certain thinkers of ancient times
this dualistic conception presented difficulties&mdash;an absolute unity
was held to be incompatible with such separation between the
world and God. The precise nature of the reflections by which
the earliest philosophers reached this conclusion is not clearly set
forth, but it may be surmised that in general there were two lines
of thought that led to this inference: first, a metaphysical conception
of unity as something that was demanded by the sense of
perfectness in the world; and, secondly, observation of facts that
appeared to characterize the world as a unit. Among several different
peoples, and apparently in each independently, the idea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>arose that the divine manifests itself in the world of phenomena
and is recognizable only therein. Such a view appears in India in
the Vedanta philosophy, and in Greece a little later it is more or
less involved in Orphic theories and in the systems of several philosophers.
The tendency to deify nature appears even in writers
who do not wholly exclude gods from their schemes of the world&mdash;in
the sayings of Heraclitus, for example: "All things are one,"
"From all comes one, and from one comes all." A similar view is
attributed to Xenophanes by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_1824" id="FNanchor_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a> and traces of such a conception
appear in Euripides.<a name="FNanchor_1825" id="FNanchor_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a> For the modern forms of pantheism,
in Spinoza and other philosophers, reference must be made to the
histories of philosophy.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1005" id="p_1005">1005</a></b>. Pantheism has never commended itself to the masses of
men. It is definitely theistic, but the view that the divine power is
visible only in phenomena and is to be identified practically with
the world is one that men in general find difficult to comprehend.
The demand is for a deity with whom one may enter into personal
relations&mdash;the simple conception of a god who dwells apart satisfies
the religious instincts of the majority of men. The ethical
questions arising from pantheism seem to them perplexing: how
can man be morally responsible when it is the deity who thinks
and acts in him? and how can he have any sense of loyalty to a
deity whom he cannot distinguish from himself? Nor do men
generally demand so absolute a unity as is represented by pantheism.
Such questions as those relating to the eternity of matter, the
possibility of the existence of an immaterial being, and the mode in
which such a being, if it exists, could act on matter, have not seemed
practical to the majority of men. Man demands a method of worship,
and pantheism does not permit organized worship. For these
reasons it has remained a sentiment of philosophers, though it has
not been without effect in modifying popular conceptions of the
deity: the conception of the immanence of God in the world (held
in many Christian orthodox circles), when carried to its legitimate
consequences, it is often hard to distinguish from pantheism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span><b><a name="p_1006" id="p_1006">1006</a></b>. <i>Nontheistic systems.</i> A further attempt to secure a
complete unity of the world appears in those systems of thought
which regard the world as self-sufficient and, therefore, dispense
with extramundane agency. These start either from the point of
view of man and human life or from contemplation of the world.
In China the sense of the sole importance of the moral life and
the impossibility of knowing anything beyond mundane life led
Confucius practically to ignore divine agency. He did not deny
the existence of Powers outside of men, but he declined to speak
of them, regarding them as of no practical importance. This
sort of agnosticism appears in Greece as early as the fifth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when Protagoras's view that "man is the measure of all
things" makes extrahuman Powers superfluous. Epicurus reached
a similar practical atheism apparently from a scientific view of
the construction of the world. According to him there are gods,
but they are otiose&mdash;living a life of happy ease, they are to be
thought of as a pleasant phenomenon in the world, but ineffective
as regards human fortunes, and men may go their ways certain
that if they obey the laws of the world the gods will not interfere
with them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1007" id="p_1007">1007</a></b>. The Sankhya philosophy of India dispenses completely
with gods, holding that the primordial stuff is eternal, but it also
holds that souls have a separate existence and are eternal. Thus
a species of dualism emerges. Buddhism goes a step further, ignoring
the soul as well as gods. It is agnostic in that, admitting the
world to have a cause, it holds that it is impossible to know this
cause. Its practical aim&mdash;to get rid of suffering by getting rid of
desire, and thus to pass into a blissful state of existence in which
apparently there is to be no effort as there is to be no pain&mdash;has
enabled it to establish a vigorous organization, a sort of church, in
which the undefined universe takes the place of a personal god,
and character takes the place of soul, this character (Karma) passing
from one being to another without the assumption of identity in
the beings thus united in destiny.<a name="FNanchor_1826" id="FNanchor_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_1008" id="p_1008">1008</a></b>. In Greece pure materialism (similar in essence to the
Sankhya) took the shape of the assumption of an original and
eternal mass of atoms whence have come all forms of being (so
Democritus in the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), and this conception was
adopted by Epicurus and expounded at length by Lucretius.<a name="FNanchor_1827" id="FNanchor_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a> The
necessary qualities and movements being attributed to the atoms,
the conclusion was that nothing else was required in order to explain
the world. With this may be compared the view of Empedocles
(fifth century) that love and hate (in modern phrase, attraction and
repulsion) are the creative forces of the world. The simplicity
of this scheme has commended it to many minds in modern as in
ancient times. Man, it is said, can know nothing outside of phenomena,
and, so far as regards the origin of things, it is as easy to
conceive of an eternal self-existent mass of matter as of an eternal
self-existent deity. The nobler part of man, it is held, is not thereby
surrendered&mdash;reason and all high ethical and spiritual ideals have
grown naturally out of the primordial mass. In such systems there
is often the hypothesis of an original force or life resident in matter,
and this force or life, being credited with all that has issued from
it, may be regarded as having the elements of personality, and in
that case becomes practically a deity. Such a deistic materialism
approaches pantheism nearly.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">General Survey of the Theistic Development</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1009" id="p_1009">1009</a></b>. The theistic conceptions of men have followed the general
line of social development. All systems and shades of thought are
faithfully reflected in the various ideas that men have formed for
themselves of the gods. Human nature is the highest thing known
to men, and their conception of supernatural forces has been based
on ideals derived from experience. The sphere of divine activity
has been determined for men by their systems of physical science;
the moral character of the gods is a reflection of human ethical
conceptions; the internal activity of the deity in man's mind is
defined by man's spiritual experience.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span></p>
<p><b><a name="p_1010" id="p_1010">1010</a></b>. From the earliest times the extent to which the gods were
supposed to intervene in human affairs has been fixed by scientific
observation, by the knowledge of natural law&mdash;the gods have been
called on to intervene only when it was necessary because ordinary
powers failed. When finally the conception is reached that all nature
is governed by natural law, the theistic view assumes that the deity
works through ordinary natural means, and the supposition of particular
interventions is rejected by the mass of scientific thinkers.
It was natural in early times to suppose that reward and punishment
were administered by the deity in this world in accordance
with the principles of right, that the good prospered and the bad
failed; but this view has vanished before observation, and, by
those who demand an exact accordance between conduct and fortunes,
the final compensations of life have been relegated to the
other world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1011" id="p_1011">1011</a></b>. The belief in miracles, however, has never completely
vanished from the world. A miracle is an intervention by the
deity whereby a natural law is set aside. No a priori reasoning
can ever prove or disprove the possibility of miracles&mdash;such proof
or disproof would involve complete knowledge of the universe or
of the divine power in the universe, and this is impossible for man.
The indisposition to accept a miracle has arisen from the conviction
that the demand for interventions that set aside the natural order
is a reflection on the wisdom of the Creator's arrangement of the
world, and further from long-continued observation of the dominance
of natural law, and, when appeal is made to alleged miraculous
occurrences, from the arbitrary way in which, according to the
reports, these have been introduced. In the records of peoples we
find that miracles increase in number and magnitude in proportion
as we go back to dim times without exact historical documents.
They appear, it is held, in connection usually with insignificant
affairs while the really great affairs in later times are left without
miraculous elements.<a name="FNanchor_1828" id="FNanchor_1828"></a><a href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">1828</a> The history of the world, so historical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>science holds, receives a satisfactory explanation from the character
of the general laws of human nature, and the principle of
parsimony demands that no unnecessary elements of action be introduced
into affairs. The exclusion of miracles from the world does
not exclude divine agency and government; it only defines the
latter as being in accordance with man's observation of natural law.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1012" id="p_1012">1012</a></b>. Philosophy constructs the constitution of the deity and
the relation of divine elements to the world. Whether the deity
stands outside of the world or within it, whether the divine power
is unitary or dual or plural, or whether there is any need to assume
a power outside of physical nature&mdash;these are the questions that
are discussed by philosophy, whose conclusions sometimes favor a
religious view of the world, sometimes oppose it. Few persons are
able to follow elaborate philosophic lines of thought&mdash;the majority
of men accept the simple doctrine of a personal god who is generally
supposed to stand outside of the world. The controlling consideration
here is that everything must have a cause&mdash;a line of
reasoning in accordance with common sense, but not always, in its
crude form, regarded by philosophers as decisive.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1013" id="p_1013">1013</a></b>. The moral character of a deity is always in accordance
with the moral ideas of his worshipers. Religions have sometimes
been divided into the ethical and the nonethical; but so far as
the character of the deity is concerned no such division holds, for
there never has been a supernatural Power that has not reflected
the moral ideas of its time and place. A cannibal god is not only
natural in a cannibal society, but he represents moral ideals, namely,
the attempt to acquire strength by absorbing the physical substance
of men. The deity who deceives or is vindictive arises in a society
in which deceit and vindictiveness are regarded as virtues. The
pictures of what we regard as immoralities in the deity as given in
the Iliad and in the Old Testament were not regarded as immoral
by the writers. The progress in the characterization of the deity
has been not by the introduction of an ethical element, but by the
purification and elevation of the already existing ethical element.<a name="FNanchor_1829" id="FNanchor_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGION</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_1014" id="p_1014">1014</a></b>. Religion is social because man is a social animal. This
does not exclude individual religion&mdash;in fact religion must have
begun with individuals, as is the case with all social movements.
Morality, indeed, understood as a system of conduct among human
beings, could not exist except in a society which included at least
two persons; but if we could imagine a quite isolated rational
being, he might be religious if, as is perfectly possible, he conceived
himself as standing in relation with some supernatural being or
beings. This question, however, is not a practical one&mdash;there is
no evidence of such isolation, and no probability that there ever
has been a time when man was not social.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1015" id="p_1015">1015</a></b>. It is generally agreed that men lived at first in small
detached groups, gradually forming tribes and nations, and finally
effecting a social fusion of nations. Religious worship has followed
these changes. Religion is simply one line of social growth existing
along with others, science, philosophy, art; all these, as is remarked
above,<a name="FNanchor_1830" id="FNanchor_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a> go on together, each influencing and influenced by the
others. Human life has always been unitary&mdash;no one part can
be severed from the others; it is a serious error, impairing the
accuracy of the conception of religion, to regard it as something
apart from the rest of human life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1016" id="p_1016">1016</a></b>. The external history of religion, then, is the history of
social growth in the line of religious organization; that is, it has
been determined by religious outward needs in accordance with the
growth of ideas. In the consideration of this history we have to note
a growth in ritual, in devotional practices, and in the organization
of religious usages, first in tribal or national communities and then
in religious communities transcending national and racial boundaries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span></p>
<h5><span class="smcap">External Worship</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1017" id="p_1017">1017</a></b>. We assume a human society recognizing some supernatural
or extrahuman object or force that is regarded as powerful and
as standing in some sort of effective relation with human life. It
is possible that societies exist that do not recognize any such object
or force or, recognizing them, do not employ any means of entering
into relation with them. Such cases, if they exist (and their
existence has not been fully established), we may pass by with the
remark that the absence of worship need be taken to show only
that ritual has been a slow growth.</p>

<p>Our information regarding the least-developed communities indicates
that with them religion, when it exists, is an affair of
custom, of tradition and usage, handed down during a period the
history of which we have no means of knowing. Worship as it
first appears consists of ceremonies, generally, perhaps always, regarded
as having objective effectiveness.<a name="FNanchor_1831" id="FNanchor_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">1831</a> The ritual act itself, in the
earliest systems, is powerful, in a sort magical, but tends to lose this
character and take on the forms of ordinary human intercourse.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1018" id="p_1018">1018</a></b>. The precise ways in which extrahuman Powers were first
approached by men it is not possible now to determine&mdash;these
procedures lie far back in a dim prehistoric time. Coming down
to our first knowledge of religious man it may be assumed that
the superhuman Powers recognized by him were of varying sorts:
a quasi-impersonal energy which, however, must probably be ascribed
ultimately to a personal being; animals; ghosts; spirits resident
in objects; anthropomorphic beings. With all these it was
necessary to establish relations, and while the methods employed
varied slightly according to the nature of the object of worship, the
fundamental cultic principle appears to have been the same for all.
Several different methods of approaching the Powers appear in
the material known to us, and these may be mentioned without
attempting exact chronological arrangement.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1019" id="p_1019">1019</a></b>. One of the earliest methods of establishing a relation with
the Powers is by certain processes&mdash;acts or words. The most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>definite example of a mere process is that found among the Central
Australians, the nature of which, however, is not yet well understood.
They perform ceremonies intended to procure a supply of
food. It is not quite clear whether these ceremonies are merely
imitations of animals and other things involved, or whether they
contain some recognition of a superhuman Power. In the former
case they are magical, not religious in the full sense of the term.
But if they involve a belief in some force or power with which man
may enter into relation, however dim and undefined this conception
may be, then they must be regarded as belonging definitely in the
sphere of religion. A certain direct effect is in many cases supposed
to issue from ritualistic acts, a belief that is doubtless a
survival of the old conception of mana.<a name="FNanchor_1832" id="FNanchor_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1020" id="p_1020">1020</a></b>. In many cases efficacy is attached by savages to singing&mdash;the
word "sing" is used as equivalent to "exert power in a
superhuman way." It is not the musical part of this procedure
that is effective&mdash;the singing is simply the natural tendency of
early man&mdash;the power lies in the words which may be regarded
as charms. A charm is primarily a form of words which has power
to produce certain results with or without the intervention of the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_1833" id="FNanchor_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a> In the form of an invocation of a deity the charm belongs
to a comparatively late stage of religion; but where its power lies
wholly in its words, it involves merely some dim sense of relation,
not necessarily religious. Obviously the idea of law underlies all
such procedures, but the law may be a sort of natural law and the
charm will then not be religious. Religious charms are to be
sharply distinguished from prayers; a prayer is a simple request,
a charm is an instrument of force.<a name="FNanchor_1834" id="FNanchor_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a> The history of the growth of
savage charms it is impossible for us to recover; it can only be
supposed that they have grown up through a vast period of time
and have been constructed out of various signs and experiences of
all sorts that appeared to connect certain words with certain results.
There is no evidence that they came originally or usually from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>prayers that had lost their petitionary character, petrified prayers,
so to speak, of which there remained only the supposition that
they could gain their ends, though bits of prayers, taken merely as
words, are sometimes supposed to have such potency. Charms
and prayers are found side by side in early stages of religion; the
former tend to decrease, the latter to increase. Charms are allied
to amulets, exorcism, and to magic in general.<a name="FNanchor_1835" id="FNanchor_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1021" id="p_1021">1021</a></b>. Certain processes and words are supposed to have power
to summon the dead and to gain from them a knowledge of the
future. This is a case of coercion by magical means. Nonmagical
coercion belongs to a relatively late period in religious history and
may be passed over at this point. It is not in itself incompatible
with religion; a god is subject to caprice and ill humor, and may
have to be controlled, and we know that coercion of the gods has
been practiced by many peoples, with the full sanction of the
religious authorities.<a name="FNanchor_1836" id="FNanchor_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a> But coercive procedures do not accord with
the general line of social development. The natural tendency is to
make friends with the gods, and coercive methods have died out
with the growth of society.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1022" id="p_1022">1022</a></b>. The methods of establishing friendly relations with the
supernatural Powers are the same as those which are employed to
approach human rulers, namely, by gifts and by messengers or
intermediaries.</p>

<p><i>Gifts</i>. The custom of offering gifts to the dead is universal.<a name="FNanchor_1837" id="FNanchor_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a>
Among low tribes and in highly civilized peoples (the Egyptians
and others) things are placed by the grave which it is supposed
the spirits of the dead will need. Food and drink are supplied,
and animals and human beings are slain and left to serve as ministers
to the ghosts in the other world. Possibly these provisions
for the dead are sometimes suggested by sentiments of affection,
but more commonly the object in making the provision appears to
be to secure the favor of the deceased: ghosts were powerful for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>good or for evil&mdash;they were numerous, always hovering round
the living, and the main point was to gain their good will. For a
similar reason such gifts were made to spirits and to gods. It was
a common custom to leave useful articles by sacred trees and
stones, or to cast them into rivers or into the sea. The food and
drink provided was always that in ordinary use among the worshipers:
grain, salt, oil, wine, to which were often added cooking
and other utensils. It was common also to offer the flesh of
animals, as, for example, among the Eskimo, the American Indians
(the Pawnees and others), the Bantu, the Limbus, and the Todas
of Southern India.<a name="FNanchor_1838" id="FNanchor_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> It was supposed that the god, when he was
in need of food, sometimes used means to stimulate his worshipers
on earth to make him an offering.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1023" id="p_1023">1023</a></b>. Since it was obvious that the food set forth for the spirit
or deity remained untouched, it was held that the gods consumed
only the soul of the food. This conception, which is found in very
early times, was natural to those who held that every object, even
pots and pans, had its soul. The ascending smoke carried with it
the essence of the food to spirits and deities&mdash;they smelled the
fragrance and were satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_1839" id="FNanchor_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> The visible material part of the
offering, thus left untouched by the god, was often divided among
his worshipers, and generally it furnished a welcome meal.
These communal feasts are found in various parts of the world,
among the Ainu of the Japan Archipelago, the American Indians,
and others.<a name="FNanchor_1840" id="FNanchor_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> They were social and economical functions. It was
desirable that the good food not consumed by the deity should be
utilized for the benefit of his worshipers. There was also the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>natural desire and custom of eating with friends. To this was
added the belief that the bodies of such animals possessed powers
which the worshiper might acquire by eating. The powers and
qualities of the animal were both natural and sacred, or divine.
The devotion of the dog, the courage and physical power of the
bear, the cleverness of the fox&mdash;all such natural powers might
be assimilated by the worshiper; and since the animal was itself
sacred, its body, taken into the human body, communicated a
certain special capacity. Thus the virtue of the communal feast
was twofold: it placated the supernatural Power, and it procured
for the worshiper a satisfactory meal and probably also an infusion
of superhuman power. The favor of the deity was gained simply
by the presents offered him; in these early times there is no
indication of the belief that there was a recognized sacramental
sharing of sacred food by the gods and their worshipers.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1024" id="p_1024">1024</a></b>. <i>Messengers.</i> The supernatural Power was sometimes approached
by a messenger who was instructed to ask a favor. The
messenger was an animal regarded as sacred, akin to men and
to gods, and therefore fitted to be an intermediary. Examples
of such a method of approaching a deity are found among the
Ainu, in Borneo, and among the North American Indians. The
Ainu, before slaying the bear who is to serve as messenger, deliver
to him an elaborate address in which he is implored to represent
to his divine kinsfolk above how well he has been treated on
earth and thus gain their favor; he is also invited to return to
earth that he may be again captured and slain. His flesh is eaten
by the worshipers, and his head is set up as an object of worship.
Thus, he is after death a divine Power and a portion of his own
flesh is offered to his head, but this is simply to gain his good will,
and there is no suggestion of a joint feast of gods and men.<a name="FNanchor_1841" id="FNanchor_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a>
Somewhat like this is the procedure in Borneo, where on special
occasions when some particular favor is desired, a pig is dispatched
with a special message to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_1842" id="FNanchor_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> In America the sacred turtle,
regarded as a brother to the tribe and affectionately reverenced by
his human brethren, is dispatched with tears to the other world to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>join his kinsmen there and be an ambassador and friend.<a name="FNanchor_1843" id="FNanchor_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a> A similar
conception is to be found perhaps in the great Vedic animal
sacrifice in which the victim was likewise made ready by ceremonies
to go to the heavenly court and there stand as the friend of the
worshipers.<a name="FNanchor_1844" id="FNanchor_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1025" id="p_1025">1025</a></b>. In all these cases there was a certain identification of the
victim with men on the one side and gods on the other. This is
simply a part of the general belief in the kinship existing between
all forms of being. Early men in choosing animal gifts for the
gods, or an animal as messenger to them, could not go astray, for
all animals were sacred. The effective means of procuring the
favor of the supernatural Powers is always a friendly gift or a
friendly messenger. When animals lost their religious prestige,
their ambassadorial function gave way to the mediatorial function
of gods and men.</p>

<p>Incense, tobacco, and other such things that were burned before
the deity are also to be regarded as food, though in the course of
time, when the recollection of this primitive character was lost, a
conventional significance was attached to the act of burning. A
more refined period demanded more refined food for the gods,
such as ambrosia and nectar, but these also were finally given up.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1026" id="p_1026">1026</a></b>. Food was conveyed to the gods either by simply laying
it down at some sacred place (where it was devoured by beasts,
but more generally taken by official ministers of the god), or by
burning it.<a name="FNanchor_1845" id="FNanchor_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> In the body of the victim the blood came to play the
most important part as an expiatory force. Early observation, as
is pointed out above,<a name="FNanchor_1846" id="FNanchor_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a> showed that the life was in the blood, and
so a principle of economy naturally suggested that it would be sufficient
to offer the blood to the deity, though this was generally
supplemented by some choice portion of the flesh. Thus, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>opinion arose that blood had a special expiatory power, and this
conception remained to a late period.<a name="FNanchor_1847" id="FNanchor_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a> But the expiatory power
rested finally on the fact that the blood was a gift of food to the
gods. The gift was most effective, apparently, when the whole of
the animal was burned, since thus the greatest honor was shown
the deity and the most ample satisfaction of his bodily needs was
furnished. The holocaust proper appears in religious history at a
comparatively late stage, but the essence of it is found in all early
procedures in which the whole of any object is given to the deity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1027" id="p_1027">1027</a></b>. <i>Human sacrifice.</i> That taste for human flesh on the part
of men is not unnatural is shown by the prevalence of cannibal customs
in many parts of the world. When such customs existed, it
was natural that the flesh of human beings should be offered to
the supernatural Powers.</p>

<p>The slaying of human beings at the graves of deceased clansmen
or friends has prevailed extensively, though apparently not
among the lowest tribes; it represents a certain degree of reflection
or intensity; it is found in the midway period when religious
customs were fairly well organized and when manners were not
yet refined. Not every slaughter at a grave, however, is an act of
religious offering to the dead. It is sometimes prompted by the
spirit of revenge, to ease the mind of the slayer, or perhaps by
desire to do honor to the deceased&mdash;doubtless there was a sentiment
of piety toward the dead.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1028" id="p_1028">1028</a></b>. The slaughter of slaves and wives to be the attendants
of the deceased in the other world is of the nature of an offering&mdash;it
is intended to procure the good will of the ghost. The self-immolation
of widows and other dependents was in some cases a
selfish act. It was supposed that the persons thus offering themselves
up would procure certain advantages in the other world,
while at the same time they would there minister to the manes of
their husbands or lords.</p>

<p>As there was no practical difference between ghosts and spirits
or gods in respect of power and influence in human life, the offering
of human beings to these last came as a matter of course.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>Their bodily appetites were the same as those of men&mdash;they were
fond of human flesh. Wherever it was necessary to invoke their
special aid this sort of offering was presented: for the success of
crops; to insure the stability of houses and bridges<a name="FNanchor_1848" id="FNanchor_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a>; to avert or
remove calamities, such as pestilence and defeat in battle.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1029" id="p_1029">1029</a></b>. While in the simpler societies human sacrifice was simply
an offering of food to the Powers, in later times it came to be conceived
of as the devotion of an object to the deity, and thus as a
sign of obedience and dependence. The offering of first-born children
was a recognition of the fact that the god was the giver of
children as of crops. The sacrifice of the dearest object, it was
supposed, would soften the heart of the deity. In some cases the
person who was supposed to be the occasion or source of misfortune
was offered up. In general, human sacrifice followed the lines
of all other sacrifices and disappeared when it became repugnant
to humane and refined feelings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1030" id="p_1030">1030</a></b>. The testimonies to its existence are so numerous that we
may suppose it to have been universal among men.<a name="FNanchor_1849" id="FNanchor_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a> There is a
trace of its early existence in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_1850" id="FNanchor_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a> In the Semitic region it is
known to have been practiced by the Ph&oelig;nicians, Carthaginians,

of the practice in Babylonia; an indication of its existence

existence in early times in India is held to be implied in the Rig-Veda.<a name="FNanchor_1853" id="FNanchor_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a>
It appears in the Brahmanic period also: a man (who had
to be a Brahman or a Warrior) was bought, allowed liberty and
the satisfaction of all his desires (except that sexual intercourse
was forbidden) for one year, and then ceremonially slain.<a name="FNanchor_1854" id="FNanchor_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a> It is
only recently that the sacrifice of children in the New Year festival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>at the mouth of the Ganges has been abolished; and it is doubtful
whether, in spite of the efforts of the British Government, it has
been completely put down among the wild tribes, as the Gonds
and the Khonds.<a name="FNanchor_1855" id="FNanchor_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> The records of China, from the eighth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> onward are said to prove the existence of human sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1856" id="FNanchor_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a>
Among the ancient Scandinavians and Germans it was frequent.<a name="FNanchor_1857" id="FNanchor_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a>
In more recent times the practice is known either to exist or to
have existed in Polynesia (Fiji, Samoa), Melanesia (Florida Islands),
Borneo (formerly),<a name="FNanchor_1858" id="FNanchor_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a> and North America (the Iroquois, the Natchez,
the Florida peninsula, and the Southwest coast).<a name="FNanchor_1859" id="FNanchor_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> Nowhere does
it appear on so large a scale as in Mexico; and it existed also in
Peru.<a name="FNanchor_1860" id="FNanchor_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a> In Africa it was practiced to a frightful extent in Ashantiland
and Dahomiland and more guardedly in Yoruba.<a name="FNanchor_1861" id="FNanchor_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1031" id="p_1031">1031</a></b>. Its gradual disappearance (a result of increasing refinement
of feeling) was marked by the substitution of other things
for human victims or of aliens for tribesmen. In early times indeed
it seems to have been slaves and captives taken in war that were
commonly sacrificed. In more civilized times the blood of a tribesman,
as more precious than other blood, was regarded as being
more acceptable to the deity, and it was then a sign of advance
when aliens were substituted for tribesmen. Lower animals were
sacrificed in place of men: in India, where the recently sown fields
had been fertilized with human blood, it became the practice to kill
a chicken instead of a human being; and so in the story of Abraham
(Gen. xxii) a ram is substituted for the human being.<a name="FNanchor_1862" id="FNanchor_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> Elsewhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>paste images are offered to the deity as representing men; an
interesting development is found in Yoruba, where the proposed
victim, instead of being sacrificed, becomes the protector of the
sacrificer; that is, he is regarded as substantially divine, as he
would have been had he been sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_1863" id="FNanchor_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1032" id="p_1032">1032</a></b>. Along with gifts, which formed perhaps the earliest
method of conciliating divine beings, we find in very early times
a number of procedures in honor of the deity, and intended in
a general way to procure divine favor. Among these procedures
dances and processions are prominent. The dance, as is observed
above,<a name="FNanchor_1864" id="FNanchor_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> is simply the transference to religious rites of a common
social act. It is, however, often supposed to have been communicated
supernaturally, and in some cases it attains a high religious
significance by its association with stories of divine persons. This
organized symbolic dance has been developed to the greatest extent
among certain North American Indian tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1865" id="FNanchor_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a> Here every actor
and every act represents a personage or procedure in a myth, and
thus the dance embodies religious conceptions. This sort of symbolism
has been adopted also in some sections of the Christian
church, where it is no doubt effective in many cases as an element
of external worship.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1033" id="p_1033">1033</a></b>. While human sacrifice continued to a comparatively late
period, it was the ordinary sort of sacrifice that constituted the
main part of the ancient religious bond of society.<a name="FNanchor_1866" id="FNanchor_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a> In the course
of time the apparatus of sacrifice was elaborated&mdash;altars, temples,
priests came into existence, and an immense organization was built
up. Sacrifices played a part in all the affairs of life, took on various
special shapes, and received different names. They were all placatory&mdash;in
every case the object was to bring men into friendly
relations with the god. They were <i>expiatory</i> when they were
designed to secure forgiveness for offenses, whether by bloody or
by unbloody offerings, or by anything that it was supposed would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>secure the favor of the deity. They were performed when it was
desired to procure some special benefit, for on such occasions it
was necessary that the deity should be well disposed toward the
supplicant; such <i>supplicatory</i> or <i>impetratory</i> sacrifices have been
among the most common&mdash;they touch the ordinary interests of
life, the main function of religious exercises in ancient times being
to procure blessings for the worshiper. These blessings secured,
it was necessary to give thanks for them&mdash;<i>eucharistic</i> sacrifices
formed a part of the regular worship among all civilized peoples.
When the crops came in, it was felt to be proper to offer a portion,
the first fruits, to the deity, as among the Hebrews and many
others, and, this custom once established, the feeling naturally
arose that to partake of the fruits of the earth before the deity
had received his part would be an impious proceeding likely to
call down on the clan or tribe the wrath of the god. When a gift
was made to a temple, since it was desirable that the deity should
accept it in a friendly spirit, a sacrifice was proper. In the numerous
cases in which some person or some object was to be consecrated
to the deity a sacrifice was necessary in order to secure his
good will; the ordination of temple-ministers, or the initiation of
the young into the tribe, demanded some <i>consecrative</i> sacrifice.
And, on the other hand, there was equal necessity for a sacrifice,
a <i>deconsecrative</i> or <i>liberative</i> ceremony, when the relation of consecration
was to be terminated (as in the case of the Hebrew
Nazirite) or when a person was to be relieved from a taboo&mdash;in
this latter case the ceremony of cleansing and of sacrificing was
intended to secure the approval of the deity in whose name and
in whose interest the taboo had been imposed.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1034" id="p_1034">1034</a></b>. Sacrifices might be individual or communal, occasional or
periodical. The early organization of society into clans made the communal
sacrifice the more prominent<a name="FNanchor_1867" id="FNanchor_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a>&mdash;the clan was the social unit,
the interests of the individual were identical with those of the clan,
and there was rarely occasion for a man to make a special demand
on the deity for his individual benefit. Such occasions did, however,
arise, and there was no difficulty in an individual's making a request
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>of the tribal god provided it was not contrary to the interests of the
tribe. If the petitioner went to some god or supernatural Power
other than the tribal god, this was an offense against tribal life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1035" id="p_1035">1035</a></b>. The great communal sacrifices were periodical. They
were determined by great turning-points in the seasons or by agricultural
interests. Sowing time; when the crops became ripe;
harvest time; midsummer and midwinter&mdash;such events were
naturally occasions for the common approach of the members of
the tribe to the tribal deity. The same thing is true of military
expeditions, which were held to be of high importance for the life
of the tribe. War was, as W. R. Smith calls it, a "holy function,"<a name="FNanchor_1868" id="FNanchor_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a>
and its success was supposed (and is now often supposed) to
depend on the supernatural aid of the deity. The particular
method of conducting the ceremonies in such cases varied with the
place and time, but the purpose of the worshiper and the general
methods of proceeding are the same among all peoples and at all
times. Occasions connected with the individual, such as birth,
initiation, marriage, death, and burial, are also affairs of the family
or clan, and the same rule applies to sacrifices on such occasions
as to the great communal periodical offerings.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1036" id="p_1036">1036</a></b>. It was inevitable that the ritual, that is, the specific mode
of procedure, should receive a great development in the course of
history. As colleges of priests were established, ceremonial elaborateness
would become natural, and precise methods of proceeding
would be handed down from generation to generation. Thus in
many cases the worshiper had to be prepared by purificatory and
other ceremonies, and the priest had to submit to certain rules
before he could undertake the sacrifice. The victim was selected
according to certain prescriptions: it had to be of a certain age or
sex, of a certain color, generally free from impurities and defects,
and sometimes it was necessary that it should show itself willing to
be sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_1869" id="FNanchor_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a> These details do not at all affect the essence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>sacrifice. They are all the result of the ordinary human tendency
to organization, to precise determination of particulars, and while
certain general features are easily understood (those, for example,
relating to the perfectness of the victim) others are the result of
considerations which are unknown to us. It would be a mistake
to seek for the origin of sacrifice in such ritualistic details.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Theories of the Origin of Sacrifice</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1037" id="p_1037">1037</a></b>. Up to a very recent time the institution of sacrifice was
generally accepted either as a natural human custom, due to
reverence for the gods, or as of divine prescription. In very early
documents, as, for example, in the Iliad and in certain parts of the
Old Testament, it is assumed that the material of sacrifice is the
food of the gods&mdash;a fact of interest in the discussion of the origin
of sacrifice, never, however, in ancient times formulated as a
theory. In the Gr&aelig;co-Roman and later Jewish periods sacrifices
seem to have been conceived of in a general way as a mark of
respect to the deity and fell more and more into disuse as the
ethical feeling became distincter. In the New Testament there is
a trace of the view that the victim is a substitute for the offerer:
in the Epistle to the Hebrews it is said that the blood of bulls and
goats could never effect the remission of sin&mdash;a nobler victim was
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_1870" id="FNanchor_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a> A similar conception is found in the later Greek and
Roman literature, but there is still no distinct theory. In the third
century of our era Porphyry, who was greatly interested in religious
matters and, doubtless, represents a considerable body of thoughtful
current opinion, says simply that sacrifices are offered to do
honor to a deity or to give thanks or to procure favors.<a name="FNanchor_1871" id="FNanchor_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a> The
early Christian writers make no attempt to explain the origin of
the custom, nor do we find any such attempt in the European philosophy
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It was not
until the spirit of historical inquiry had entered the sphere of religious
investigation that the question as to the historical beginning
and the significance of sacrifice was fairly put.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span><b><a name="p_1038" id="p_1038">1038</a></b>. In discussions of this question a distinction is sometimes
made between bloody and unbloody offerings&mdash;they are supposed
to differ in placatory or expiatory virtue, and one or the other of
them is held to precede in order of time. The facts seem, however,
not to warrant this distinction. Everywhere the two sorts of
offering have equal power to please and placate the deity; the
special prominence that may be given to the one or the other is
due to peculiar social conditions that do not affect the essential
nature of the rite.<a name="FNanchor_1872" id="FNanchor_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> As to precedence of one or the other in time
the available data offer nothing definite beyond the fact that choice
between them is determined by the circumstances of a community&mdash;the
material of an offering is whatever (food or other thing)
seems natural and appropriate in a particular place and at a particular
time, and this may vary, of course, in the same community
at different stages of culture.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1039" id="p_1039">1039</a></b>. Current theories of the origin and significance of sacrifice
divide themselves into two general groups, the one laying stress
on the idea of gift, the other on the idea of union with the deity.
Both go back ultimately to the same conception, the conviction,
namely, that man's best good can be secured only by the help of
the supernatural Powers; but they approach the subject from different
points of view and differ in their treatment of the rationale
of the ritual.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1040" id="p_1040">1040</a></b>. The conception of an offering as a gift to a deity is found
in very early times and is common in low tribes. In Greece the
word for "gift," as offering, occurs from Homer on, and in Latin
is frequent, and such a term is employed in Sanscrit. The common
Hebrew term for sacrifice (<i>min&#7723;a</i>) has the same sense; it is used
for both bloody and unbloody offerings, though from the time of
Ezekiel (sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) onward it became a technical term
for cereal offerings.<a name="FNanchor_1873" id="FNanchor_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> The details of savage custom are given by
Tylor,<a name="FNanchor_1874" id="FNanchor_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> who proposes as the scheme of chronological development
"gift, homage, abnegation." This order, which is doubtless real,
embodies and depends on growth in social organization and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>consequent growth in depth and refinement of religious feeling.
The object of a gift is to procure favor and protection; homage
involves the recognition of the deity as overlord, and, in the higher
stages of thought, as worthy of reverence&mdash;always, however, with
the sense of dependence and the desire for benefits; abnegation is
the devotion of one's possessions and, ultimately, of one's self; this
idea sometimes assumes a low form, as if the deity were pleased
with human loss and suffering, or as if human enjoyment were
antireligious,<a name="FNanchor_1875" id="FNanchor_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a> sometimes approaches the conception of the unity
of the worshiper with the object of worship.<a name="FNanchor_1876" id="FNanchor_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1041" id="p_1041">1041</a></b>. A special form of the gift-theory, with a peculiar coloring,
is that which holds that some object is substituted for the worshiper
who has fallen under the displeasure of the deity and is in
danger of punishment. This conception, however, is found only
in the most advanced religions. The cases in which an animal is
substituted for a human victim<a name="FNanchor_1877" id="FNanchor_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a> are of a different character&mdash;they
are humane reinterpretations of old customs. In early popular
religion the only examples of a deity's deliberately inflicting
on innocent persons the punishment of another's wrongdoing are
connected with the old conception of tribal and national solidarity&mdash;&OElig;dipus,
Achan, David, and others, by their crimes, bring misfortune
on their peoples; when the guilty have received their
punishment the innocent are relieved. A real vicarious suffering
is not found in these cases or in any ancient sacrificial ritual&mdash;the
victim is not supposed to bear the sin of the sacrificant.<a name="FNanchor_1878" id="FNanchor_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> It is
only in comparatively late theological constructions that vicarious
atonement occurs. Some Jewish thinkers were driven to such a
theory by the problem of national misfortune. The pious and
faithful part of the nation, the "Servant of Yahweh," had shared
in its grievous sufferings, and, as the faithful did not deserve this
punishment, the conclusion was drawn that they suffered for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>iniquities of the body of the people;<a name="FNanchor_1879" id="FNanchor_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a> their suffering, however,
was to end in victory and prosperity. In this conception the theory
of solidarity is obvious, but it differs from the old tribal theory in
that the suffering of the innocent brings salvation to the whole
mass. In the prophetic picture there is no explanation of how
this result was to be brought about&mdash;there is no mention of a
moral influence of the few on the many&mdash;only there is the implication
that the nation, taught by suffering, would in future be faithful
to the worship of the national deity. It does not appear wherein
the ethical and religious significance of the unmerited suffering of
the pious consisted; apparently the object of the writer is merely
to account for this suffering and to encourage his countrymen. In
another passage,<a name="FNanchor_1880" id="FNanchor_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a> suffering is represented as having in itself expiatory
power; the view in this case is that a just deity must punish
sin, forgives, however, when the punishment has been borne.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1042" id="p_1042">1042</a></b>. The view that the efficacy of sacrifice is due to the fact
that it brings about a <i>union between the deity and the worshiper</i> has
been construed in several different ways according as the stress is
laid on one or another of the elements of the rite. One theory
represents atonement, the reconciliation of god and man, as effected
by the physical act of sharing the flesh of a sacred animal; another
finds it in the death of an animal made sacred and converted into
an intermediary by a series of ceremonies; a third holds that union
with the divine is secured by whatever is pleasing to the deity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1043" id="p_1043">1043</a></b>. <i>Reconciliation through a communal meal.</i> Meals in which
the worshipers partook of the flesh of a sacred animal (in which
sometimes the dead animal itself shared) have probably been celebrated
from an immemorial antiquity. Examples of such customs
among savages are given above.<a name="FNanchor_1881" id="FNanchor_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a> A familiar instance of a communal
meal in civilized society is the Roman festival in which the
shades of the ancestors of the clan were honored (the <i>sacra gentilicia</i>)&mdash;a
solemn declaration of the unity of the clan-life.<a name="FNanchor_1882" id="FNanchor_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> A more definite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>act of social communion with a deity seems to be recognizable in the
repasts spread in connection with the Eleusinian mysteries, which
appear, however, to have been merely a social attachment to the
mysteries proper.<a name="FNanchor_1883" id="FNanchor_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a> In the feasts of the Mithraic initiates, in which
mythological symbolism is prominent, a more spiritual element
becomes visible: the participant absorbs something of the nature
of the god&mdash;power to overcome evil, with hope of immortality.<a name="FNanchor_1884" id="FNanchor_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1044" id="p_1044">1044</a></b>. In the ancient records of these ceremonies there is no
theory of the means by which man comes into friendly relations
with the deity. The meal is an act of friendly intercourse&mdash;it
doubtless involves the ancient belief that those who eat together
thus absorb a common life and are bound together by a strong tie.
In the earliest and simplest instances the feeling apparently is that
the communion is between the human participants&mdash;the divine
animal is honored as a brother; but, even when, as among the
Ainu,<a name="FNanchor_1885" id="FNanchor_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a> he receives a part of the food, the tie that binds him to them
rests on the fact of original kinship rather than on the communal
eating. Later the view that the god was pleased and placated by
the nourishment offered him assumed more definite form;<a name="FNanchor_1886" id="FNanchor_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a> but it
is doubtful whether on such occasions man was regarded as the
guest of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_1887" id="FNanchor_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1045" id="p_1045">1045</a></b>. However this may be, it is the effect of the food on the
god that has been made by W. Robertson Smith the basis of an
elaborate theory of sacrifice;<a name="FNanchor_1888" id="FNanchor_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a> his view is that the assimilation of
the flesh and blood of the kindred divine animal strengthens the
deity's sense of kinship with his worshipers, and thus, promoting
a kindly feeling in him, leads him to pardon men's offenses and
grant them his protection. Smith's argument is mainly devoted to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>illustrating the ancient conception of blood-kinship between gods,
men, and beasts. He assumes that sacrifice is the offering of food
to the deity (the blood of the animal, as the seat of life, coming
naturally to be the most important part of the offering), the sacredness
of the victim, and the idea of communion, and further that
the victim is a totem&mdash;the existence of totemism in the Semitic
area, he holds, though not susceptible of rigid proof, is made practically
certain by the wide diffusion of the totemic conception
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1889" id="FNanchor_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> As evidence that the effective thing in sacrifice is the
sharing of sacred flesh and blood, he adduces a great number of
offerings (such as the shedding one's own blood and the offering
of one's hair) in which there is no death of a victim, and no idea
of penal satisfaction of the deity. In the Israelite ritual he lays
special stress on the common clan-sacrifice (the <i>zeba&#7717;</i>) in which a
part of the victim is given to the god and a part is consumed by
the worshiper; this he contrasts with offerings that are given
wholly to the god, and, leaving aside piacula and holocausts, this
distinction he makes correspond to that between animal and
vegetable offerings, the latter, he holds, being originally not conciliatory.
Thus, he concludes, the expiatory power lies in the
sharing of animal flesh. Here the theory is confronted by the
holocaust and the piaculum, expiatory sacrifices in which there is
no communal eating. Smith meets this difficulty by suggesting
that these two sorts of sacrifice belong to a relatively late period,
when, in the progress of society, the original conception had become
dim. As time went on, he says, the belief in kinship with animals
grew fainter. Sacrificial meals became merely occasions of feasting,
and at the same time the establishment of kingly government
familiarized men with the idea of tribute&mdash;so sacrifice came to be
regarded as a gift and the victim was wholly burnt (holocaust);
the same result was reached when the feeling arose that the victim
was too sacred to be eaten&mdash;it must be otherwise disposed of
(piaculum). The piacula he refers to times of special distress, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>recourse was had to the sacrifice of ancient sacred animals, old
totems (Hebrew: "unclean" animals), supposed to have special
potency.<a name="FNanchor_1890" id="FNanchor_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a> It is true that in the course of time certain old conceptions
grew dim, but this does not set aside the fact that expiatory
power was supposed to attach to animal sacrifices in which there
was no communal eating; though some of these were late, they
doubtless retained the old idea of the nature of the efficacy of
sacrifice.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1046" id="p_1046">1046</a></b>. In Smith's theory there is confusion between the two
ideas of communion and expiation or placation. All the facts adduced
by him go to show only that the earliest form of animal
sacrifice took the form of communal eating; and in such repasts,
as in the savage feasts on the bodies of warriors and others, the
prominent consideration seems to have been the assimilation of
the qualities of the thing consumed&mdash;in this case a divine animal.
There is not a word of proof of the view that the placation of the
deity was due to his assimilation of kindred flesh and blood. Such
a view is not expressed in any ancient document or tradition, and,
on the other hand, placation by gifts of food (animal or vegetable)
and other things appears in all accounts of early ritual. Even in
the sacramental meals of later times, Eleusinian, Christian, and
Mithraic, there is no trace of the theory under consideration. In
the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" (ix f.) the conception of
the eucharistic meal is simply symbolical. The origin of the
Australian custom<a name="FNanchor_1891" id="FNanchor_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a> (in which the food brought in by a clan is not
eaten till the old men have first tasted it) is obscure; but there is
no hint that the food was supposed to be shared by a supernatural
being.<a name="FNanchor_1892" id="FNanchor_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> Piacula arose under the influence of a deep sense of individual
relation to the deity, and sometimes in connection with
voluntary associations in which a special sanctity was held to
accrue to the initiates through the medium of a cult in which
special sacrifices were prominent It was natural that peculiarly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>solemn or dreadful offerings should be made to the deity in times
of great distress; the placating efficacy in such cases seems to
have been due to the pleasure taken by the deity in the proof of
devotion given by the worshipers. In general, the communal meal
lost its early significance as time went on, and came at last to be
celebrated merely as a traditional mark of respect to the deity, or
as a social function; the belief in its efficacy, however (and sometimes
belief in its magical power), survived into a relatively late
period.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1047" id="p_1047">1047</a></b>. In one point, the death of the god, J. G. Frazer, while
accepting Smith's theory in general, diverges from his view.
Smith regards the death of the god as having been originally the
sacrificial death of the divine totem animal, with which later the
god was identified. Frazer<a name="FNanchor_1893" id="FNanchor_1893"></a><a href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a> (here following Mannhardt<a name="FNanchor_1894" id="FNanchor_1894"></a><a href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a>) finds its
origin in the death of the vegetation-spirit (the decay of vegetation),
which was and is celebrated in many places in Europe, and furnishes
an explanation of the myths of Adonis, Attis, Osiris, Dionysus,
Demeter and Proserpine, and Lityerses. This explanation is
adopted and expanded by Hubert and Mauss.<a name="FNanchor_1895" id="FNanchor_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a> So far as the
mere fact of the sacrifice of a divine being is concerned it might
be accounted for by either of these theories; but the numerous
points of connection between the deities in question and the ancient
ideas concerning the death of vegetation make the view of
Mannhardt and Frazer the more probable. The kernel of the
original custom is not expiation but celebration or worship; the
myths are dramatic developments of the simple old idea. Frazer
suggests that the spirit or god, supposed to be enfeebled by age,
was slain by the worshipers in order that a more vigorous successor
might infuse new life into the world&mdash;an explanation that is
possible but cannot be considered as established or as probable.<a name="FNanchor_1896" id="FNanchor_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a>
However this may be, it was at a relatively late period that the
conception of communion was introduced into ceremonies connected
with the death of a deity. Originally the grain, identified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>with the god, was eaten in order to acquire his strength;<a name="FNanchor_1897" id="FNanchor_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> such
seems to be the purpose in the Mexican ceremonies in which paste
images of the deity were eaten by all the people. With the growth
of moral and spiritual conceptions of worship such communal
eating came naturally to be connected with a sense of union of
soul with the deity, as we find in the higher religions, but still without
the feeling that reconciliation and unity were effected through
the absorption, by god and man, of the same sacred food.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1048" id="p_1048">1048</a></b>. In some forms of Christianity the sacramental eating is
brought into connection with the atoning death of a divine person,
but this latter conception came independently by a different line of
thought. Its basis is the idea of redemption, which is an element
in all sacrifice proper. And, as the death of the divine victim is
held to rescue the worshiper from punishment for ill doing, the
conclusion is natural that the former stands in the place of the
latter. In the higher forms of thought such substitution could only
be voluntary on the part of the victim. Traces of the self-sacrifice
of a god have been sought in such myths as the stories of the
self-immolation of Dido and Odin; but the form and origin of
these myths are obscure<a name="FNanchor_1898" id="FNanchor_1898"></a><a href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a>&mdash;all that can be said of them in this
connection is that they seem not to contain expiatory conceptions.<a name="FNanchor_1899" id="FNanchor_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">1899</a>
The higher conception of a divine self-sacrifice is a late historical
development under the influence of convictions of the moral majesty
of God and the sinfulness of sin.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1049" id="p_1049">1049</a></b>. <i>Union with the divine through a sanctified victim.</i> The
conception of sacrifice as bringing about a union of the divine and
the human is reached in a different way from that of Smith by
MM. Hubert and Mauss, and receives in their hands a peculiar
coloring.<a name="FNanchor_1900" id="FNanchor_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a> They hold that the numerous forms of sacrifice cannot
be reduced to "the unity of a single arbitrarily chosen principle";
and in view of the paucity of accurate accounts of early ritual (in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>which they include the Greek and the Roman) they reject the
"genealogical" (that is, the evolutionary) method, and devote themselves
to an analysis of the two ancient rituals, the Hindu and the
Hebrew, that are known in detail and with exactness. They thus
arrive at the formula: "Sacrifice is a religious act which, by the
consecration of a victim, modifies the state of the moral person
who performs it, or of certain objects in which this person is interested."
The procedure in sacrifice, they say, consists in establishing
a communication between the sacred world and the profane
world by the intermediation of a victim, that is, of a thing that is
destroyed in the course of the ceremony; it thus serves a variety
of purposes, and is dealt with in many ways: the flesh is offered
to hostile spirits or to friendly deities, and is eaten in part by worshipers
or by priests; the ceremony is employed in imprecations,
divination, vows, and is redemptive by the substitution of the victim
for the offender; the soul of the beast is sent to join its kin
in heaven and maintain the perpetuity of its race; all sacrifices
produce either sacralization or desacralization&mdash;both offerer and
victim must be prepared (for the victim is not, as Smith holds,
sacred by nature, but is made sacred by the sacrifice), and, the
ceremony over, the person must be freed from his sanctity (as
in the removal of a taboo); all sacrifice is an act of abnegation,
but the abnegation is useful and egoistic, except in the case of the
sacrifice of a god.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1050" id="p_1050">1050</a></b>. The essay of MM. Hubert and Mauss is rather a description
of the mode of procedure in Hindu sacrifice than an
explanation of the source of its power. A victim, it is said, sanctified
by the act of sacrifice, effects communication between the
two worlds, but we are not told wherein consists this sanctifying
and harmonizing efficacy. The rituals chosen for analysis are the
product of many centuries of development and embody the conceptions
of theological reflection; it does not appear why they
should be preferred, as sources of information concerning the
essential nature of sacrifice, to the simple rites of undeveloped
communities. The authors of the essay, though they deny the
possibility of finding a single explicative principle chosen arbitrarily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
themselves announce a principle, which, however, amounts simply
to the statement that sacrifice is placatory. In thus ascribing the
virtue of the ceremony to the act itself it is possible that they may
have been influenced by the Brahmanic conception that sacrifice
had power in itself to control the gods and to secure all blessings
for men; it was credited by them with magical efficacy, and the
efficacy depended on performing the act with minutest accuracy
in details&mdash;the slightest error in a word might vitiate the whole
proceeding.<a name="FNanchor_1901" id="FNanchor_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a> The developed Hindu system thus embodied in learned
form the magical idea that is found in many early procedures, and
in some other cults of civilized communities. So far as regards the
variety of functions assigned by MM. Hubert and Mauss to sacrifice,
they may all be explained as efforts to propitiate supernatural
Powers; and the obligation on priests and worshipers to purify
themselves by ablutions and otherwise arises from a sense of the
sacredness of the sacrificial act, which is itself derived from the
feeling that the sacredness of supernatural beings communicates
itself to whatever is connected with them. The view that the victim
is not in itself sacred is contradicted by all the phenomena of
early religion. Though the essay of MM. Hubert and Mauss formulates
no definition of the ultimate efficient cause in sacrifice,
passing remarks appear to indicate that they look on the offering
as a gift to superhuman Powers, and that their object is to show
under what conditions and circumstances it is to be presented.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1051" id="p_1051">1051</a></b>. <i>Sacrifice as the expression of desire for union with the
Infinite.</i> Professor C. P. Tiele, dissatisfied with existing theories
of the significance of sacrifice, contents himself with a general
statement.<a name="FNanchor_1902" id="FNanchor_1902"></a><a href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a> After pointing out that the material of sacrifice in
any community is derived from the food of the community, he
passes in review briefly the theories of Tylor (gifts to deities),
Spencer (veneration of deceased ancestors), and Robertson Smith;
all these, though he thinks it would be presumptuous to condemn
them hastily, he finds insufficient, most of them, he says, confining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>themselves to a single kind of offering, whereas every kind should
be taken into account, gifts presented, objects and persons consecrated,
victims slain with or without repasts, possessions and
pleasures renounced, acts of fasting and abstinence, every kind
of religious self-denial or self-sacrifice. The question being whether
one and the same religious need is to be recognized in all the varieties,
he finds the root of sacrificial observances in the yearning of
the believer for abiding communion with the supernatural Power
to which he feels himself akin, the longing of finite man to become
one with the Infinity above him.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1052" id="p_1052">1052</a></b>. Tiele here has in mind the highest form of the religious
consciousness, which he carries back to the beginnings of religious
thought. He is justified in so doing in so far as all later developments
must be supposed to exist in germinal form at the outset of
rational life; but such a conception tells us nothing of the historical
origin of customs. The idea of the relation between the finite and
the infinite is not recognizable in early thought; to trace the history
of such an institution as sacrifice we desire to know in what sort
of feeling it originated, and we may then follow its progress to its
highest definition. All the details mentioned by Tiele are included
under the head of gift except acts of abstinence and self-sacrifice,
and these last belong properly not to what is technically known as
"sacrifice," but to man's endeavor to bring himself into ethical
harmony with an ethical deity. With equal right prayer and all
moral conduct might here be included; Tiele thinks of "sacrifice"
as embracing the whole religious life. In the earliest known cults
the "yearning for union with the Infinite" takes the form of desire
to enter into friendly relations with superhuman Powers by
gifts, in order to derive benefit from them; when old forms have
been outgrown the conviction arises that what is well-pleasing to
God is the presentation of the whole self, as a "living sacrifice,"
in service in accordance with reason (Rom. xii, 1).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1053" id="p_1053">1053</a></b>. The various theories of the origin and efficacy of sacrifice
(omitting the ambassadorial conception) are thus reducible to three
types: it is regarded as a gift, as a substitution, or as an act
securing union (physical or spiritual) with the divine. These have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
all maintained themselves, in one form or another, up to the present
day. The old ritual slaughter of an animal and the presentation
of vegetables and other things have, indeed, vanished. The movement
of thought against animal sacrifice began in the Western
world (among the Greeks and the Hebrews) probably as early as
the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_1903" id="FNanchor_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a> In Greece the formulation of philosophic
thought and the rise of individualism in religion (embodied, for example,
in the great Mysteries) brought larger and more spiritual
ideas into prominence. Rational law and inward impulse took the
place, in the higher circles, of ritual offerings. The object of law,
says Plato, is the encouragement of virtue of all kinds and the
securing of the highest happiness; but, he holds, there is something
higher than law: the good Athenian is above other men,
for he is the only man who is freely and genuinely good by inspiration
of nature, and is not manufactured by law.<a name="FNanchor_1904" id="FNanchor_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> The Mysteries
assumed that every man, with suitable inward preparation, was
fitted to enter into a spiritual union with the deity. The later Jews
showed equal devotion to their law, held to be divinely given, laying
the stress on the moral side;<a name="FNanchor_1905" id="FNanchor_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a> jurists became more important than
priests, and the synagogue (representing individual worship) more
influential than the temple-ritual. In certain psalms<a name="FNanchor_1906" id="FNanchor_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a> sacrifice is
flatly declared not to be acceptable to God; this attitude had been
taken by the earlier prophets,<a name="FNanchor_1907" id="FNanchor_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a> but is emphasized in the psalms in
the face of the later opinion that the sacrificial ritual was of divine
ordination (so in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers). In the Gospels
the sacrificial ritual is practically ignored. In India the Brahmanic
and Buddhistic movements toward rational conceptions of religion
showed themselves as early as the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Thus, over
a great part of the civilized world intellectual and moral progress
took the form of protest against the old idea of sacrifice.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1054" id="p_1054">1054</a></b>. Yet old customs are long-lived, and the ancient theories,
as is remarked above, still have a certain power. The crudest of
them&mdash;that the deity may be propitiated by gifts&mdash;shows itself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>in the belief that ill-doing may be atoned for by the support of
charitable and religious institutions&mdash;by the building of churches
and hospitals, by the maintenance of religious worship, and by aid
to the poor. Society has benefited largely by this belief, especially
in medieval Europe and to some extent in Buddhistic and Moslem
communities; it has formed a transition to higher conceptions, by
which it has now been in great measure replaced. The same thing
is true of ascetic observances. The idea of sacrificial substitution,
which has been prominent in organized Christianity from an early
period (though it has no support in the teaching of Jesus), might
seem to be prejudicial to religion for the reason that it tends to
depress the sense of individual responsibility by relegating the
reconciliation with the deity to an external agency&mdash;and such has
often been its effect; but this unhappy result has been more and
more modified, partly by the natural human instinct of moral responsibility
and the ethical standard of the Christian Scriptures,
partly by the feeling of gratitude and devotion that has been called
forth by the recognition of unmerited blessing. The third theory
of sacrifice, according to which its essence is union with the divine,
has passed gradually from the sphere of ritual to that of moral
culture. In mystical systems, Christian and Moslem, it has lent
itself sometimes to immorality, sometimes to a stagnant, egoistic,
and antisocial quietism; but in the main it has tended to avoid
or abandon mechanical and mystical features, and confine itself
to the conception of sympathetic and intelligent co&ouml;peration with
what may be regarded as the divine activities of the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1055" id="p_1055">1055</a></b>. <i>Further external apparatus of religion.</i> Along with the
growth of sacrifice there has been a natural development of everything
that was necessary to give permanent form to public worship&mdash;ritual,
priests, temples, idols, and whatever was connected with
the later church organizations.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Ritual</span></h5>

<p>Apart from magical procedures the earliest known public religious
worship consisted simply in the offering of an animal, a
vegetable, a fluid, or other object to a superhuman being, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
offering being performed by any prominent person and without
elaborate ceremonies. Inevitably, however, as the social organization
grew more complex and the conception of sanctity more
definite, the ceremonial procedure became more elaborate. The
selection and the handling of the victim came to be objects of anxious
care, and the details increased in importance as they increased
in number. It was believed that minute accuracy in every ritual
act was necessary for the success of the offering. Various elements
doubtless entered into this belief: often a magical power was attributed
to the act of sacrifice; and there was a feeling, it may be
surmised, that the deity was exacting in the matter of ceremonies&mdash;these
were marks of respect, such as was paid to human potentates,
and well-defined court rituals (on which the religious ritual
was probably based) appear in early forms of society. Thus ritual
tended to become the predominant element in worship, serving first
the interests of unity and order in religion, and later always in danger
of becoming a mechanical and religiously degrading influence.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1056" id="p_1056">1056</a></b>. In most savage and half-civilized communities sacrifice
is a simple affair, and the details of the ceremonies of worship
are rarely reported by travelers and other observers.<a name="FNanchor_1908" id="FNanchor_1908"></a><a href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a> An exception
exists in the case of the Todas of Southern India, who have elaborate
ceremonies connected with the milking of buffaloes.<a name="FNanchor_1909" id="FNanchor_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a> The
ordinary buffaloes of a village are cared for by some prominent
man (never by a woman), who is sometimes a sacred person and
while carrying on his operations performs devotional acts (prayer
and so forth), but without a fixed ritual. A higher degree of sanctity
attaches to the institution called <i>ti</i>, which comprises a herd of
buffaloes belonging to a clan and provided with dairies and grazing-grounds;
each dairy has appropriate buildings, and the <i>ti</i> is
presided over by a sort of priest called a <i>palol</i>. The migration of
the buffaloes from one grazing-ground to another is conducted as
a sacred function. In the case of an ordinary herd the procession
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>of animals is accompanied by a religious official who carries the
dairy implements; on reaching the destination the new dairy is purified,
the sun is saluted, and prayer is offered. In a <i>ti</i> migration the
procedure is more elaborate: the milking of the buffaloes is accompanied
by prayers for the older and the younger members of the
herd, and every act of the <i>palol</i> is regulated by law. The same thing
is true of the animal sacrifices: the slaughter of the victim and
the disposal of the various parts are accomplished in accordance
with definite rules that are handed down orally from one generation
to another. The Todas are a non-Aryan people, hardly to be called
half-civilized: if the buffalo-ritual is native with them, the natural
inference will be that the custom is ancient. Rivers adduces a considerable
number of similarities between Toda institutions and those
of the Malabar coast (such as polyandry and other marriage institutions),
and this agreement, as far as it goes, may point to a common
culture throughout a part of Southern India;<a name="FNanchor_1910" id="FNanchor_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a> the early history of
these tribes is, however, obscure. It is possible that the Todas have
borrowed some customs from the Hindus. They have certainly
adopted some Hindu gods, and Rivers suspects Hindu influence
in their recognition of omens and lucky and unlucky days, in certain
of their magical procedures, and in their use of pigments and
ashes in some sacred ceremonies. There seems, however, to be no
proof that the buffalo-ritual has been borrowed from the Hindus.
On this question, which is of importance as bearing on the early history
of ritual, it is to be hoped that further information will be got.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1057" id="p_1057">1057</a></b>. Various nonsacrificial rituals (dances and so forth) are
referred to above.<a name="FNanchor_1911" id="FNanchor_1911"></a><a href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a> Magical processes should be here included so
far as they involve a recognition of superhuman agents; they are
then to be regarded as religious. Definite magical ritual is found
in many of the lower tribes, and there are ceremonies in which a
shaman is the conductor&mdash;these are governed by fixed customs
as to dress, posture, acts, and words.<a name="FNanchor_1912" id="FNanchor_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a> They differ from magical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>processes in that they are assemblies of the people, religious because
there is communication with spirits. In the Californian tribes
and others they become occasions of merrymaking; a peculiar feature
of these gatherings among the Maidu and other tribes is the
presence of a clown who mimics the acts and words of the dancers
and performs knavish tricks; the origin of this feature of the
dances is not clear. In all such ceremonies the tendency to regulate
the details of religious performances is apparent, and such
regulation is found in so many parts of the world that it may be
regarded with probability as universal.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1058" id="p_1058">1058</a></b>. For the ancient national religions we have the fullest
details in the case of the Hindus and the Hebrews. The Hindu
sacrificial ritual is described by MM. Hubert and Mauss;<a name="FNanchor_1913" id="FNanchor_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a> the
Hebrew procedure is given in the later sections of the Pentateuch.<a name="FNanchor_1914" id="FNanchor_1914"></a><a href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a>
The Egyptian ritual also appears to have been elaborate, including
much music.<a name="FNanchor_1915" id="FNanchor_1915"></a><a href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">1915</a> These show methods similar to those described above,
and probably the same general modes of procedure were followed
in Babylonia and Persia, though of the ritual in these countries
only slight notices have been handed down.<a name="FNanchor_1916" id="FNanchor_1916"></a><a href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">1916</a> The great Chinese
Imperial sacrifices are described by H. Blodget.<a name="FNanchor_1917" id="FNanchor_1917"></a><a href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">1917</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1059" id="p_1059">1059</a></b>. These national systems exhibit a gradual quiet enlargement
of the ritual resulting from increasing specialization in the
conception of sin and forgiveness and in the functions of religious
officials. A different sort of development appears in the rites of
the cults that sprang up on the ruins of the old faiths&mdash;Greek
Mysteries, Mithraism, Isisism, Christianity. These were all redemptive
religions, highly individualistic and intense, efforts to
infuse into old forms the ideas concerning moral purity, union
with the deity, immortality, and future salvation that had arisen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>in the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world by the natural growth of thought and
the intermingling of the various existing schemes of religious life.
They are all marked by a tendency toward elaborate organization,
a sharp differentiation from the national cults, and purificatory and
other ceremonies of initiation. The differentiation was most definite
in Christianity, the ritual was most highly developed in the other
movements. In the Greek public Mysteries<a name="FNanchor_1918" id="FNanchor_1918"></a><a href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">1918</a> and in those of
Mithra<a name="FNanchor_1919" id="FNanchor_1919"></a><a href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">1919</a> there were (besides ablutions) the old communal meals,
processions, striking dramatic performances, and brilliant effects
of light and music, and in Mithraism trials of courage for the
neophyte after the manner of the old savage initiations. The
ceremonies in the Isis cult were less sensational, more quiet and
dignified.<a name="FNanchor_1920" id="FNanchor_1920"></a><a href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">1920</a> In all these cults there was symbolism, and the moral
teaching was of a lofty character.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1060" id="p_1060">1060</a></b>. Christian ritual was at first simple,<a name="FNanchor_1921" id="FNanchor_1921"></a><a href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">1921</a> but rapidly grew in
elaborateness. The liturgy and the eucharistic ceremonies were
expanded into great proportions, and came to be the essence of
worship. This movement went on throughout Christendom (with
variations here and there) up to the rise of Protestantism, and after
that time continued in the Greek and Roman Churches. Protestantism,
in its recoil from certain doctrines of the Church of Rome,
threw off much of its ceremonial, which in the minds of the people
was associated with the rejected dogmas. Since the separation, however,
especially in the last hundred years, the violent antagonism having
largely quieted down, there has been in some Protestant bodies
a slow but steady movement in the direction of ritualistic expansion;
procedures that three centuries ago would have called forth earnest
protest are now accepted and interpreted in accordance with Protestant
ideas. Doubtless the temperament of a people has something
to do with the amount of ceremonial it favors in religious service.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1061" id="p_1061">1061</a></b>. The history of ritual thus shows that it tends to grow
in elaborateness and importance as social forms become more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>elaborate and important&mdash;the mode of approaching the deity
imitates the mode of approaching human dignitaries, postures are
borrowed from current etiquette.<a name="FNanchor_1922" id="FNanchor_1922"></a><a href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">1922</a> Form was especially sought after
under the old monarchies, Egyptian and Assyrian.<a name="FNanchor_1923" id="FNanchor_1923"></a><a href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> The exaggerated
Oriental court etiquette, introduced into Roman life as early
as the time of Diocletian, was maintained and developed under the
Byzantine emperors.<a name="FNanchor_1924" id="FNanchor_1924"></a><a href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a> These usages may have affected the growth
of the Greek and Roman Church liturgies.<a name="FNanchor_1925" id="FNanchor_1925"></a><a href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">1925</a> In modern China,
under the imperial government, divine worship was substantially
identical in form with the worship of the emperor. In some cases
it may be doubtful in which direction the borrowing has been.</p>

<p>The expansion of liturgical forms has often been accompanied
by the effort to interpret them symbolically. Intelligent reflection
has led to the conviction that forms without religious meaning are
valueless, and it has been easy, after ceremonies were established,
to attach spiritual definitions to their details. This relieves their materialism,
and gives a certain realness and force to religious feeling.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Priests</span><a name="FNanchor_1926" id="FNanchor_1926"></a><a href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1062" id="p_1062">1062</a></b>. A priest is a person commissioned by the community or
its head to conduct the sacrificial service and related services connected
with shrines. Such a person differs in two respects from
the religious official of the simplest times, the magician (shaman,
or medicine man): the latter acts in his own name and by his own
authority, and the methods he employs are magical&mdash;they are
based on the belief that the supernatural Powers are subject to
law and may be controlled by one who knows this law; the priest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>acts in the name and by the authority of the community, and his
methods are dictated by the friendly social relation existing between
the community and the Powers. He differs, further, from those
religious ministrants (chiefs of clans, fathers of families, and other
prominent men) who acted by virtue of their social or political
positions in that his functions are solely religious and are in that
regard distinct from his civil position. He represents a differentiation
of functions in an orderly nonmagical religious society. Such
an office can arise only under a tolerably well-organized civil government
and a fairly well-defined sacrificial ritual. It is doubtless
a slow growth, and there may be, in a community, a period of
transition from one grade of religious ministers to another when
the distinction between the priest and the magician or between
the priest and the headman is hardly recognizable; the distinction
comes, however, to be well marked, and then indicates an important
turning-point in religious history. It may be, also, that at
certain times under certain circumstances the civil ruler may have
priestly functions or the priest may exercise civil authority; but
these exceptional cases do not affect the specific character of the
sacerdotal office.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1063" id="p_1063">1063</a></b>. The priest is a sacred person, and is affected by all the
conditions pertaining to the conception of "sacred." In early
times he has to be guarded against contamination by impure or
common (profane) things, and care has to be taken that his quality
of sacredness be not injuriously communicated to other persons or
to any object.<a name="FNanchor_1927" id="FNanchor_1927"></a><a href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a> The parts of his person, such as hair and nail-parings,
must not be touched by common folk. The dress worn
by him when performing his sacred duties must be changed when
he comes out to mix with the people. He must keep his body
clean, and the food that he may or may not eat is determined by
custom or by law. His sexual relations are defined&mdash;sometimes
he is forbidden to marry or to approach a woman, sometimes the
prohibition extends only to marriage with a certain sort of woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>(a foreigner, a widow, or a harlot). In some cases he is forbidden
to engage in warfare or to shed human blood;<a name="FNanchor_1928" id="FNanchor_1928"></a><a href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">1928</a> the ground of this
prohibition was physical, not moral.<a name="FNanchor_1929" id="FNanchor_1929"></a><a href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">1929</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1064" id="p_1064">1064</a></b>. Similar rules in regard to food, marriage, chastity applied
to priestesses.<a name="FNanchor_1930" id="FNanchor_1930"></a><a href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">1930</a> Women were often, in ancient times, the ministrants
in the shrines of female deities&mdash;there was a certain propriety
in this arrangement; they were, however, in some cases
attached to the service of male deities.<a name="FNanchor_1931" id="FNanchor_1931"></a><a href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">1931</a> Their duties were in
general of a secondary character: they rarely, if ever, offered
sacrifice;<a name="FNanchor_1932" id="FNanchor_1932"></a><a href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">1932</a> they were often in charge of the temple-music; the
function of soothsaying or of the interpretation of oracular sayings
was sometimes assigned them. On the other hand, female
ministrants in temples, who were closely connected with temple
duties, were sometimes considered as wives of the god, and in
some cases had sexual relations with priests and worshipers, and
became public prostitutes.<a name="FNanchor_1933" id="FNanchor_1933"></a><a href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">1933</a> This custom does not exist among the
lowest tribes, and it attained its largest development in some of
the great civilized cults. It seems not to have existed in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_1934" id="FNanchor_1934"></a><a href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor">1934</a>
The consecrated maidens described in the Code of Hammurabi
appear to have been chaste and respected;<a name="FNanchor_1935" id="FNanchor_1935"></a><a href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor">1935</a> the relation between
these and the harlots of the early Ishtar cult is not clear. A distinction
may be made between priestesses proper and maidens
(hierodules) consecrated to such a deity as Aphrodite Pandemos;
Solon's erection of a temple to this goddess, which he supplied
with women, may have been an attempt to control the cult of
the het&aelig;r&aelig;. The thousand hierodules at Corinth<a name="FNanchor_1936" id="FNanchor_1936"></a><a href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">1936</a> were probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>not priestesses, and the same thing may be surmised to be true of
the women devoted to the Semitic prototype of Aphrodite, the
Syrian Ashtart (Astarte), and to the Babylonian Ishtar.<a name="FNanchor_1937" id="FNanchor_1937"></a><a href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">1937</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1065" id="p_1065">1065</a></b>. The origin of temple prostitution is not clear. In many
cases (in Greece, Rome, Mexico, Peru, and elsewhere) the consecrated
women were required to be virgins and to remain chaste&mdash;this
higher conception is obviously the natural one in a civilized
community in which the purity of wives and daughters is strictly
guarded. The old idea that sexual union was defiling may have
originated or strengthened the demand for chastity. The institution
of the lower class of women does not seem to have originated
in a society in which this regard for purity is lacking, for the hierodulic
class is rarely if ever found in existing societies of this sort.
The origin of the class is not to be sought in a low valuation of
woman, nor, on the other hand, is it to be found in a desire to
secure fruitfulness; fruitfulness is generally secured by offerings
to the gods, and though the belief has doubtless existed that it
could be secured by commerce with a supernatural being,<a name="FNanchor_1938" id="FNanchor_1938"></a><a href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">1938</a> there
is no trace of this belief in the accounts of the lives of the hierodules;
the benefit would be restricted also to a small number of
women. Probably the custom was developed gradually and, like
other such customs, had its ground in simple needs. Women were
required for the menial work of shrines.<a name="FNanchor_1939" id="FNanchor_1939"></a><a href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a> Once established in service,
they would acquire a certain sanctity and power by their relation
to sacred things, and at the same time would, as unattached, be
sought by men. Their privileges and license would grow with
time&mdash;they would become an organized body, and would seek
to increase their power. In the course of time current religious
ideas, low or high, would attach to them. They would be supposed
to be in the confidence of the deity, able to interpret his
will, and endowed with the power of cursing or blessing.<a name="FNanchor_1940" id="FNanchor_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a> With
the growth of refinement they would be thought of as servants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>of the deity, belonging to him and to no other, and might be
described, as in fact they are sometimes described, as his wives.
The title "wife" would be compatible with purity in the higher
religious systems, but in the lower systems would be connected
with license.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1066" id="p_1066">1066</a></b>. <i>Theories of the origin of religious prostitution.</i> The license
just referred to is a part of a widespread custom of the prostitution
of sacred persons, of which various explanations have been offered.<a name="FNanchor_1941" id="FNanchor_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a>
The existence of the custom is attested for the larger part of the
ancient civilized and half-civilized world, and for many more recent
peoples. In old Babylonia, Canaan, Syria, Ph&oelig;nicia, Asia Minor,
Armenia, Greece, and now in West Africa and India, we find
officially appointed "sacred" women a part of whose religious
duty it was or is to offer themselves to men.<a name="FNanchor_1942" id="FNanchor_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a> The service in
ancient times was not regarded as degrading; on the contrary,
maidens of the noblest families were sometimes so dedicated, and
the r&ocirc;le of devotee might be continued in a family for generations.<a name="FNanchor_1943" id="FNanchor_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a>
Such service was sometimes a necessary preliminary to marriage.
This seems to be the case in the custom reported by Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1944" id="FNanchor_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor">1944</a>
that every native Babylonian woman had, once in her life, to sit
in the temple of Mylitta (Ishtar) and wait till a piece of money
was thrown into her lap by a stranger, to whom she must then
submit herself&mdash;this duty to the goddess accomplished, she lived
chastely. In Byblos a woman who refused to sacrifice her hair to
Ashtart on a certain festival day had to yield herself to a stranger.<a name="FNanchor_1945" id="FNanchor_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a></p>
<p>Official male prostitutes also there were in some ancient cults;
but information about such persons is scanty, and they seem not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>to have been numerous.<a name="FNanchor_1946" id="FNanchor_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor">1946</a> The most definitely named case is that
of the Hebrew official class called <i>kedeshim</i>, that is, persons devoted
to the service of the deity and therefore sacred<a name="FNanchor_1947" id="FNanchor_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> (as it is
said in Zech. xiv, 20 ff., that bells on horses and temple-vessels shall
be sacred to Yahweh). These, together with the female devotees,
<i>kedeshot</i> ("prostitutes"), are denounced as abhorrent to Yahweh;
both were features in the ritual of the Jerusalem temple of the
seventh century B.C. and apparently earlier.<a name="FNanchor_1948" id="FNanchor_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a> The female devotee
is called a "harlot" and the male a "dog" (<i>kalb</i>). The original
religious sense of the latter term is uncertain. In the Old Testament
it occurs, in this sense, only in the passage cited above. In
a Ph&oelig;nician inscription of Larnaca (in Cyprus)<a name="FNanchor_1949" id="FNanchor_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">1949</a> the plural of the
word designates a class of attendants in a temple of Ashtart, and
there are proper names in which the term is an element (and
therefore an honorable title). It is not improbable that it meant
originally simply a devotee or minister of a god in a temple,<a name="FNanchor_1950" id="FNanchor_1950"></a><a href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor">1950</a> the
bad sense having been attached to it in the Old Testament from
the license sometimes practiced by such ministers.</p>

<p>The sentiment of chastity is a product of the highest civilization.
In many savage and half-civilized tribes the obligation on a
woman to keep herself pure is not fully recognized, and in the
case of married women the opposition to unfaithfulness sometimes
springs from the view that it is a violation of the husband's
right of property in the wife. In some ancient civilized communities
a god's right to a woman seems to have been taken for
granted.<a name="FNanchor_1951" id="FNanchor_1951"></a><a href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor">1951</a> Ordinary prostitution seems to have existed in the world,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>in all grades of civilization, from the earliest times. This attitude
toward the custom being so widespread, it is not strange that it
has established itself in religious organizations.</p>

<p>Two types of organized religious prostitution have to be considered:<a name="FNanchor_1952" id="FNanchor_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a>
there is the Babylonian (Mylitta) type, in which every
woman must thus yield herself before marriage; and there is the
attachment of a company of official public women to a temple
permanently or for a considerable time. The explanations that
have been offered of these institutions fall into two classes, one
tracing their origin to some nonreligious custom, the other regarding
them as originally religious (these classes are, however,
not necessarily mutually exclusive).</p>

<p><i>Secular explanations.</i> It has been held that all such customs go
back to a period of sexual promiscuity,<a name="FNanchor_1953" id="FNanchor_1953"></a><a href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor">1953</a> which has been modified
in the course of ages. It is doubtful whether such a period ever
existed,<a name="FNanchor_1954" id="FNanchor_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a> but it is certain that prenuptial license has been common,
and this laxity may have prepared the way for organized prostitution.
More particularly, reference is made to puberty defloration
ceremonies, when the girl is handed over to certain men no one of
whom can, by tribal rule, be her husband&mdash;that is, before marriage
she becomes sexually the property of the tribe through its regularly
appointed representatives, and is thus prepared for membership;
then, it is added, at a later period, when religious service has been
established, the girl is given over or devoted not to the tribe but to
the tribal god, in whose shrine she must submit to defloration, in
accordance with rules fixed from time to time. The act thus becomes
religious&mdash;it is a recognition of the sovereignty of the deity, and
procures divine favor. Such may be a possible explanation of the
procedure in the temple of Mylitta and at Byblos.<a name="FNanchor_1955" id="FNanchor_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a> But the meaning
of the condition imposed at these places, namely, that the man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>to whom the woman yields herself must be a stranger, is not clear.
It is hardly probable that an outsider was called on to perform
what was regarded as a dangerous duty&mdash;a stranger would not
be likely to undertake what a tribesman feared to do.<a name="FNanchor_1956" id="FNanchor_1956"></a><a href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a> Nor is the
power of a stranger to confer benefits so well established that we
can regard his presence as intended to bring a blessing to the girl.<a name="FNanchor_1957" id="FNanchor_1957"></a><a href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a>
More to the point, in one respect, is the conjecture that we have
here an attenuated survival of the exogamic rule&mdash;the girl must
marry out of her social group;<a name="FNanchor_1958" id="FNanchor_1958"></a><a href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a> the old social organization having
disappeared, the "stranger" takes the place of the original functionary,
and the deity the place of the clan. This explanation has
much in its favor; but, as it is hardly possible to establish an historical
connection between the older and the later custom, it cannot
be said to be certain, and the origin of the "stranger-feature"
remains obscure.</p>

<p><i>Religious explanation.</i> Sacred prostitution is supposed by many
writers to have sprung from the cult of the goddess who represented
the productive power of the earth<a name="FNanchor_1959" id="FNanchor_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a> (Mother Earth, the
Great Mother). While such a figure is found in many of the
lower tribes, it is only among civilized peoples, and particularly in
Western Asia, that the cult acquired great importance. By the side
of the female figure there sometimes stands a male representative
of fertility (Tammuz by the side of Ishtar, Attis by the side of
Kybele) who is regarded as the husband or the lover of the goddess,
but occupies a subordinate position. In early times the goddess is
represented as choosing her consorts at will, but this is merely an
attribution to her of a common custom of the period. All deities,
male and female, might be and were appealed to for increase of
crops and children, but a Mother goddess would naturally be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>looked on as especially potent in this regard. Prayer would be
addressed to her, and that, with offerings, would be sufficient to
secure her aid; simply as patroness of fertility she would not
demand prostitution of her female worshipers&mdash;some special
ground must be assumed for this custom, and it is held that, as
fertility was produced by the union of the goddess with her consort
or her lovers, this union must be imitated by the women who
sought a blessing from her.<a name="FNanchor_1960" id="FNanchor_1960"></a><a href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a> The probability of such a ground for
sacred prostitution is not obvious. There are communities of
temple-courtesans (in West Africa and India) where such an idea
does not exist. If the license was in imitation of the goddess, this
feature of her character requires explanation, and the natural explanation
is that such a figure is a product of a time of license. In
the ancient world it was only in Asia Minor and the adjacent
Semitic territory that religious orgies and debauchery existed&mdash;they
seem to have been an inheritance from a savage age. Or,
if the prostitution is explained as a magical means of obtaining
children,<a name="FNanchor_1961" id="FNanchor_1961"></a><a href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a> this also would go back to a religiously crude period.
Magical rites, many and of various sorts, have been performed by
women desiring offspring&mdash;imitations and simulations.<a name="FNanchor_1962" id="FNanchor_1962"></a><a href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a> But the
giving up of the body is not imitation or simulation&mdash;it is the
procreative act itself.</p>

<p>Organized official sacred prostitution must be regarded as the
outcome of a long period of development. License, starting at a
time when sexual passion was strong and continence was not
recognized as a duty or as desirable, found entrance into various
social and religious customs and institutions, accommodating itself
in different places and periods to current ideas of propriety. Appropriated
by organized religion, it discarded here and there its
more bestial features, adopted more refined religious conceptions,
its scope was gradually reduced, and finally it vanished from religious
usage. The objections urged to such a process of growth are
not conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_1963" id="FNanchor_1963"></a><a href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a> Explanations of communities of temple-courtesans

are suggested above.<a name="FNanchor_1964" id="FNanchor_1964"></a><a href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a> Many influences, doubtless, contributed to
the final shaping of the institution, and we can hardly hope to
account satisfactorily for all details; but the known facts point
to an emergence from savage conditions and a gradual modification
under the influence of ideas of morality and refinement.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1067" id="p_1067">1067</a></b>. <i>Organization and influence of the priesthood.</i> In accordance
with the law of natural human growth the priests in most of
the greater religions came to form an organized body, hierarchical
grades were established, many privileges were granted them, and
they exercised great influence over the people and in the government.
In Egypt they were exempt from taxes and had a public
allowance of food; the temples at the capitals, Memphis and
Thebes, became enormously wealthy; the priests exercised judicial
functions (but under the control of the king); they cultivated
astronomy and arithmetic, and controlled the general religious life
of the people; as early as the thirteenth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> they had
attained a political power with which the kings had to reckon, and
still earlier (ca. 1400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) the Theban priests were able to overthrow
the religious reformation introduced by Amenhotep IV;
the departments of sacerdotal functions were multiplied, and the
high priest of the Theban Amon, whose office became hereditary,
controlled the religious organization of the whole land, set himself
up as a rival of the Pharaoh in dignity, and finally became the
head of a sacerdotal theocracy.<a name="FNanchor_1965" id="FNanchor_1965"></a><a href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1068" id="p_1068">1068</a></b>. While the Babylonian and Assyrian priesthoods were not
so highly organized as the Egyptian, and never attained great
political power, they were nevertheless very influential. Astronomy
and astrology, the interpretation of omens and portents, the science
of magic and exorcisms, the direction of the religious life of kings
and people were in the hands of the priests; the great temples
were rich, there were various classes of temple-ministers, all well
cared for, and the chief priest of an important shrine was a person
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>of great dignity and power. The interpretation of sacrificial phenomena
was made into a science by the priests, and, passing from
them to Greece and Italy, exerted a definite influence on the
religious life of the whole Western world.<a name="FNanchor_1966" id="FNanchor_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1069" id="p_1069">1069</a></b>. The process of organizing the Hebrew priesthood began
under David and Solomon, at first, under Solomon (who favored
the Zadok family), affecting only the Jerusalem temple. In the
Northern kingdom (established about 930 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) there seems to
have been a similar arrangement. As long as the old royal governments
lasted (the Northern kingdom fell in the year 722 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the
Southern in 586) the priests were controlled by the kings. On the
building of the Second Temple (516) and the reorganization of
the Judean community they became, under Persian rule, independent
of the civil government and finally, in the persons of the
high-priests, the civil heads of the Palestinian Jews. The Maccabean
uprising resulted in the establishment of the Asmonean
priest-dynasty, in which the offices of civil ruler and religious leader
were united. After the fall of this dynasty (37 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) the priestly
party (the Sadducees, that is, the Zadokites), forming an aristocracy,
conservative of ritual and other older religious customs and
ideas, was engaged in a constant struggle with the democratic
party (the Pharisees), which was hospitable to the new religious
ideas (resurrection, immortality, legalism). The latter party was
favored by the people, and with the destruction of the temple
(70 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) the priests disappeared from history. From the beginning
they appear to have been not only religious ministrants and guides
but also civil judges; their great work was the formulation of the
religious law, as it appears in the Pentateuch, and it is probable
that the shrines (especially that of Jerusalem) were centers of
general literary activity. The national development turned, however,
from sacerdotalism to legalism&mdash;the later religious leaders
were not priests but doctors of law (Scribes and Pharisees).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1070" id="p_1070">1070</a></b>. In India the priests formed the highest caste, were the
authors of the sacred books (which they alone had the right to
expound), conducted the most elaborate sacrificial ceremonies that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>man has invented, and by ascetic observances, as was believed, sometimes
became more powerful than the gods.<a name="FNanchor_1967" id="FNanchor_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a> Ritual propriety was
a dominant idea in India, and the influence of the priesthood on
the religious life of the people was correspondingly great. Priests
did not attempt to interfere in the civil government, but their religious
instruction may sometimes have affected the policy of civil
rulers. On the other hand, the Hindu priesthood, by its poetical
productions and its metaphysical constructions, has become a
permanent influence in the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1071" id="p_1071">1071</a></b>. The early (pre-Zoroastrian) history of the Mazdean priesthood
is obscure. In the Avestan system, however, a great r&ocirc;le is
assigned the priests, as is evident from the vast number of regulations
concerning ceremonial purity, of which they had charge.<a name="FNanchor_1968" id="FNanchor_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a>
It does not appear that the early sacerdotal organization was
elaborate or strict. There were various classes of ministrants at
every shrine, but they differed apparently rather in the nature of
their functions than in rank.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1072" id="p_1072">1072</a></b>. The Greek priestly class had the democratic tone of the
Greek people.<a name="FNanchor_1969" id="FNanchor_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a> There was little general organization: every priest
was attached to a particular deity except the Athenian King Archon,
who had charge of certain public religious ceremonies. The mutual
independence of the Greek States made the creation of a Hellenic
sacerdotal head impossible. In Sparta the priestly prerogatives of
the king were long maintained; usually, however, there was a
separation of civil and religious functions. Generally in Greece
priests were chosen by lot, or were elected by the priestly bodies
or by the people, or were appointed by kings or generals. They
were usually taken from good families, were held in honor, and
were housed and fed at the public expense (their food came largely
from sacrificial offerings). It was required that they should be
citizens of the place where they officiated, and should be pure in
body and of good conduct. They seem to have been simply citizens
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>set apart to conduct religious ceremonies, and their influence on the
general life was probably less than that of civil officers, poets, and
philosophers. Greek educated thought moved at a relatively early
period from the conventional religious forms toward philosophical
conceptions of the relation between the divine and the human.<a name="FNanchor_1970" id="FNanchor_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1073" id="p_1073">1073</a></b>. The minute details of the Roman ritual might seem to
give great importance to priests;<a name="FNanchor_1971" id="FNanchor_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a> and the flamens (the ministers
of particular deities) were of course indispensable in certain sacrifices.
But the organization of Roman society was not favorable
to the development of specifically sacerdotal influence. Religion
was a department of State and family government. For the manifold
events of family life there were appropriate deities whose
worship was conducted by the father of the family. The title <i>rex</i>
(like the Greek <i>basileus</i>), in some cases given to priests, was a
survival from the time when kings performed priestly functions.
Later the consul was sometimes the conductor of public religious
ceremonies. There was hardly a religious office, except that of
the flamen, that might not be filled by a civilian. In the Augustan
revival membership in the College of the Arval Brothers was sought
by distinguished citizens. It was thought desirable that the Pontifex
Maximus, the most influential of the priests, should be a jurist;
and the office was held by such men as Julius C&aelig;sar and Augustus.
The increase of temples and priests by Augustus did not materially
change the religious condition. The adoption of foreign cults was
accompanied by ideas that did not belong to the Roman religion
proper. In general, if we except the augurs, who represent the
lowest form of the sacerdotal office, the priest was relatively uninfluential
in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_1972" id="FNanchor_1972"></a><a href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1074" id="p_1074">1074</a></b>. The minimum of priestly influence is found in the national
religion of China, in which there is no priestly class proper.<a name="FNanchor_1973" id="FNanchor_1973"></a><a href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a> In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>the worship of ancestors, which satisfies the daily religious needs
of the people, every householder and every civil official is a ministrant.
The great annual sacrifices to the heavenly bodies have
been conducted till recently by the emperor in person.<a name="FNanchor_1974" id="FNanchor_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a> Public
religion is, in the strictest sense, a function of the State. Society,
according to the Chinese view, is competent to manage relations
with the supernatural Powers&mdash;it needs no special class of intermediaries.
This thoroughgoing conception of civic autonomy in
religion connects itself with the supreme stress laid on conduct in
the Confucian system, which represents the final Chinese ideal of
life:<a name="FNanchor_1975" id="FNanchor_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a> man constructs his own moral life, and extrahuman Powers,
while they may grant physical goods, are chiefly valued as incidents
in the good social life. The great speculative systems of thought,
Confucianism and Taoism, gradually gave rise to definite sacerdotal
cults; but the priests of the Confucian temples serve mainly to
keep before the people the teaching of the Master, and the Taoist
priests have become largely practicers of magic and charlatans.
Chinese religious practice remains essentially nonsacerdotal.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1075" id="p_1075">1075</a></b>. The Peruvian cult presents a remarkable example of a
finely organized hierarchy closely related to the civil government.<a name="FNanchor_1976" id="FNanchor_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a>
The priests were chosen from the leading families; the highpriest
was second in dignity to the Inca only. The functions of the priests
were strictly religious; and as the masses of the people were devoted
to the worship of local deities and natural objects, it seems
probable that the sacerdotal influence was merely that which belonged
to their supervision of the State religion. Details on this
point are lacking.</p>

<p>Priests played a more prominent part in Mexico, entering, as
they did, more into the life of the people.<a name="FNanchor_1977" id="FNanchor_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> On the one hand, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>numerous human sacrifices, of which the priests had complete control,
kept the terrible aspect of religion constantly before the mind
of the public; and, on the other hand, the milder side of the cult
(for the Mexican religion was composite) brought the priests into
intimate relations with adults and children. As the priests, apart
from their monstrous sacrificial functions, appear to have been
intelligent and humane, it is not unlikely that their general moral
influence was good.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1076" id="p_1076">1076</a></b>. The influence of the priesthood on religion (and on civilization
so far as religion has been an element of civilization) has
been of a mixed character. On the one hand, while not the sole
representative of the idea of the divine government of the world
(for soothsayers and prophets equally represented this idea), it
has stood for friendly everyday intercourse between man and the
deity, and has so far tended to bring about an equable and natural
development of the ordinary religious life; it was involved in the
sacerdotal functions that the deity might be placated by proper
ceremonies, whence it followed that the priest, who knew the
nature of these ceremonies, was a benefactor, and, more generally,
that man had his salvation in his own hands. The business
of the priest was to maintain the outward forms of religion, to
order and elaborate the ritual, to organize the whole cultus.<a name="FNanchor_1978" id="FNanchor_1978"></a><a href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a> This
was a work that required time and the co&ouml;peration of many minds.
Priests were, in fact, naturally drawn together by a common aim
and common interests&mdash;with rare exceptions they lived in groups,
formed societies and colleges, had their traditions of policy, gathered
wealth.<a name="FNanchor_1979" id="FNanchor_1979"></a><a href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a> For this reason they were in general opposed to
social changes&mdash;they were a conservative element in society, and
in this regard were the friends of peace.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1077" id="p_1077">1077</a></b>. On another side they did good work; they were to some
extent the guardians of morals. In ancient popular life ethics was
not separated from religion&mdash;religion adopted in general the best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>moral ideas of its time and place and undertook to enforce obedience
to the moral law by divine sanctions. Priests announced,
interpreted, and administered the law, which was at once religious
and ethical; they were teachers and judges, and this function of
theirs was of prime importance, particularly where good systems
of popular education did not exist. Further, as a leisured class
they often turned to literary occupations; examples of their literary
work are found in India (poetry and philosophy), Babylonia
(the history of Berossus), Palestine (Old Testament Psalter, the
works of Josephus). They offered a place of rest in the midst of
the continual warfare of ancient times.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1078" id="p_1078">1078</a></b>. On the other hand, the priesthood has been generally
conservative of the bad as well as of the good. It has maintained
customs and ideas that had ceased to be effective and true, and in
order to preserve them it has resorted to forced interpretations and
has invented accounts of their origin. It has thus in many cases
been obscurantive and mendacious. It has tended to make the
essence of religion consist in outward observances, and has not
infrequently degraded the placation of the deity to a matter of
bargaining&mdash;it has sold salvation for money. Priests have not
always escaped the danger that threatens all such corporations&mdash;that
of sacrificing public interests to the interests of the order.
They have drifted naturally toward tyranny&mdash;the enormous power
put into their hands of regulating men's relations with the deity
has led to the attempt to regulate men's general thought, though
in most of the great religions their power in this regard has been
partly controlled by the civil authority and by the general intelligence
of the community. When they have not been controlled,
they have often succumbed to the temptations that beset wealth;
they have fallen into habits of luxury and debauchery.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1079" id="p_1079">1079</a></b>. In a word the history of the priesthood has been like
that of all bodies of men invested with more or less arbitrary
power. Its r&ocirc;le has varied greatly in different places and at different
times. It has numbered in its ranks good men and bad, and
has favored sometimes righteous, sometimes unrighteous, causes.
It is not possible to define its influence on religion further than to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
say that it has been a natural element of the organization of religion,
taking its form and coloring from the various communities
in which it has existed, embodying current ideas and thus acting as
a uniting and guiding force at a time when higher forces were lacking.
It has formed a transitional stage in the advance of religious
thought toward better conceptions of the relation of man to the deity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1080" id="p_1080">1080</a></b>. Islam has no priesthood, as it has no provision for atonement
for sin except by the righteous conduct of the individual; its
cultic officials are preachers or leaders of prayer (imams) in the
mosque worship, and jurists or scholars (ulamas) who interpret
the Koran. Judaism has had no priests since the destruction of
the Second Temple (70 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>); its synagogue services are conducted
by men trained in the study of the Bible or the Talmud
(rabbis). In Christianity the conception of a sacrificial ministrant
has been retained in those churches (the Greek and the Roman)
which regard the eucharistic ceremony as a sacrifice. In the West
the "presbyter" (such is the New Testament term), the head of
the congregation, took over the function of the old priest as conductor
of religious worship, and the word assumed the form
"priest" in the Latin and Teutonic languages. Among Protestants
it is employed only in the Church of England, in which, however,
for the most part it has not the signification of 'sacrificer.'</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Worship</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1081" id="p_1081">1081</a></b>. <i>Places of worship</i>. The simplest form of early worship
is the presentation of an offering to the dead or to some extrahuman
object of reverence. Such objects were held to exist in all
the world, in the sky, in rocks, streams, woods, caves, hills and
mountains, and beneath the surface of the earth; but it was chiefly
in places of human resort that their presence was expected. On
some natural object or at some spot regarded as sacred, particularly
where, it was believed, a spirit or deity had manifested himself
(in some remarkable natural phenomenon, or in some piece
of good fortune or ill fortune), the worshiper would place his offering.
Sometimes it was left to be disposed of by the deity or spirit
or dead person at his pleasure. When the offering was an animal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
the blood, as food, was often applied to the grave or to the stone
or other object connected with a superhuman Power. In the course
of time, it may be supposed, it would be found convenient to erect
a table or some other structure on which an animal could be slain.
Such a structure would be an altar. At first simple, a heap of
stones, a pile of dirt, a rough slab, it was gradually enlarged and
ornamented,<a name="FNanchor_1980" id="FNanchor_1980"></a><a href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a> and itself, by association, became sacred.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1082" id="p_1082">1082</a></b>. Places where the presence of the divine was recognized
were sacred. In them worship was paid to the deity, and in the
course of time they were marked off and guarded against profane
use. At first, however, they were merely spots on hills or in groves,
by streams or in the open country, needing no marks or watches,
for they were known to all and were protected by the reverence
of the people.<a name="FNanchor_1981" id="FNanchor_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> When the land came to be more thickly populated
and religion was better organized, such places were inclosed and
committed to the care of official persons. Well-known examples
are the Greek <i>temenos</i> and the Arabian <i>haram</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1982" id="FNanchor_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a> Taboos and privileges
attached themselves to such inclosures. Precautions had to
be taken on entering them; the shoes, for example, were removed,
lest they should absorb the odor of sanctity and thus become unfit
for everyday use. The spaces thus set apart were sometimes of
considerable extent (as was and is the case at Mecca); within them
no war could be waged and no fugitive seized. Sometimes they
owed their sacredness to the buildings to which they were attached.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1083" id="p_1083">1083</a></b>. The necessity for a house of worship arose very early.<a name="FNanchor_1983" id="FNanchor_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a>
Where there was an image or a symbol of a god, or where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>apparatus of sacrifice or of other ritual practice was considerable,
buildings were required for the protection of these objects and
perhaps for the convenience of the ministrants. The development
of buildings followed the course of all such arrangements&mdash;at
first rude, they became gradually elaborate and costly. In many
savage tribes and in the earliest period of civilized peoples (Egyptians,
Hebrews, al.) a hut, constructed like those of the people and
therefore of a very simple character, houses the image or other
representative of the god. With the progress of artistic feeling
and skill abodes of men grow into palaces and abodes of deities
into temples. It is on the temples that the greatest labor has been
expended, partly because they are the work of the whole community,
partly because it has been believed that the favor of the
deity would be gained by making his dwelling-place magnificent.<a name="FNanchor_1984" id="FNanchor_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a>
The essential fact in a temple&mdash;its definition&mdash;is (in the lower
cults) and was (in the great ancient cults) that it is or was the
home of a god, the specific place of approach to him, with the
possibility of face-to-face intercourse and a greater probability of
gaining the blessings desired. This local conception of the deity
continued after larger ideas had arisen,<a name="FNanchor_1985" id="FNanchor_1985"></a><a href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a> and is to be found at the
present day in some Christian circles.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1084" id="p_1084">1084</a></b>. Temples have tended to grow not only in beauty and magnificence
but also in elaborateness of interior arrangements and of
connected structures. Anciently they were specifically places of
sacrifice&mdash;the abodes of gods to whom sacrifice was offered&mdash;and
this function generally determined their interior form. Sometimes
they contained a single room in which stood an image and
an altar; this was the simplest architectural embodiment of the
idea of divine sacredness. But the progress of ritual forms was
accompanied by the notion of grades of sanctity, and a special
sanctity was indicated by a special room, an adytum, an inner or
most holy shrine;<a name="FNanchor_1986" id="FNanchor_1986"></a><a href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a> where, as was often the case, gradations in
priestly rank existed, only the highest priest could enter the adytum.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>For the implements of service and for the priests there were buildings
attached to the temple. The people gathered in courts adjoining
the sacred structure; where ritual exactness was carried
very far (as in Ezekiel's plan and in Herod's temple), there were
gradations in the courts also.<a name="FNanchor_1987" id="FNanchor_1987"></a><a href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a> Usually an altar stood in one of
the courts. The sacredness of the sanctuary communicated itself
to the vessels and other implements of the sacrificial service.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1085" id="p_1085">1085</a></b>. Temples, like sacred inclosures and altars, were often
asylums, and doubtless in many cases served to protect innocent
persons. The privilege, however, was often abused, and it became
necessary in Greece and Rome to restrain it.<a name="FNanchor_1988" id="FNanchor_1988"></a><a href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1086" id="p_1086">1086</a></b>. As a factor in the development of art the temple has
been important. It has called forth the best architectural skill of
man, and the statues that often adorned sacred buildings have
stimulated sculpture. It does not appear that symbolism entered
into the idea of ancient temples.<a name="FNanchor_1989" id="FNanchor_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a> The Babylonian and Assyrian
zikkurat (or ziggurat) was a staged structure (resembling in this
regard the Egyptian pyramid), supposed by many scholars to be
an imitation of the mountains whence the predecessors of the
Semites in Babylonia came, and on which they worshiped;<a name="FNanchor_1990" id="FNanchor_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a> if
this be so, there is no attempt at pointing upward to the abode
of the gods. Nor is there any trace elsewhere in the ancient
world of a symbolic significance attached to temples beyond the
distinction of place, referred to above, between the sacred and
the profane and between different degrees of sacredness. The
form of temples appears to have been determined by imitation of
early nonreligious usage or by considerations of convenience;<a name="FNanchor_1991" id="FNanchor_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a>
the ziggurat may have been suggested by a high place, the adytum
by a cave, but most temples were probably copies of ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>human dwellings or civic buildings (as in late Latin, basilica is
used in the sense of 'cathedral').</p>

<p>As abodes of priests temples were the centers of all priestly
activities in the development of ritual and literature. Being strong
and well guarded they were often used by kings as treasure-houses;
but they were stripped of their wealth by native kings in times of
need, and were freely plundered by conquerors.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1087" id="p_1087">1087</a></b>. <i>Forms of worship.</i> The ancient forms of divine worship,
as is remarked above,<a name="FNanchor_1992" id="FNanchor_1992"></a><a href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a> follow in a general way the modes of approaching
human potentates. Ceremonies of worship reached a
high degree of elaboration in the great religions, Egyptian, Babylonian-Assyrian,
Hebrew, Hindu, Greek, Roman.<a name="FNanchor_1993" id="FNanchor_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a> The central
fact was the presentation of the offering, and with this came to
be connected prayers and hymns, ceremonies of purification, vows,
imprecations, exorcisms, oracles; the festivals also were religious
functions. Prayer is spoken of below.<a name="FNanchor_1994" id="FNanchor_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a> Hymns sometimes consisted
of or contained petitions, more generally were laudations of
the power and benefactions of a deity. For poetical charm the
first place is to be assigned to the Egyptian, Hebrew, and Hindu
hymns. The religious ideas expressed in such compositions varied
with time and place, but they show a general tendency toward a
monolatrous or henotheistic point of view and toward higher ethical
and spiritual feeling. Many of the Egyptian hymns seem to
be substantially monotheistic, and the same thing is true of the
Babylonian, the Assyrian, and the Vedic. The Babylonian hymns
so far recovered (belonging in their present form mostly to the
seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) are chiefly penitential<a name="FNanchor_1995" id="FNanchor_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a> and show a close
resemblance to some Hebrew psalms. In the Veda traces of
philosophical thought, pantheistic and other, are not lacking. The
poems of the Old Testament Psalter vary greatly in breadth and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>elevation of thought&mdash;some, dealing generally with national affairs
(occasionally with individual experiences), are narrow and ethically
low; others show exalted conceptions of the deity and fine moral
feeling. The Avestan ritual is concerned largely with physical
details, but is not lacking in a good ethical standard; the Gathas,
particularly, though not free from national coloring, give a noteworthy
picture of the government of the world according to
moral law. Of Greek ritual hymns we have few remains, and
these are of no great interest.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1088" id="p_1088">1088</a></b>. Everywhere the temple-hymns, as is natural, deal chiefly
with the desires and hopes of the worshiper, and often do not rise
above mere egoism. Their object is to secure blessing, and the
blessing is often, perhaps generally, of a nonmoral character&mdash;wealth,
children, triumph over enemies. Desire for moral purity
appears in some Hebrew hymns, and perhaps in some Babylonian.
Of the modes of presenting liturgical poems to the deity we have
few details. In the Second Temple at Jerusalem there were choruses
of ministrants (Levites), and some of the titles of the psalms contain
what seem to be names of musical instruments and melodies;
but of this temple-music nothing further is known than that it was
sometimes sung antiphonally, but without harmony.<a name="FNanchor_1996" id="FNanchor_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> In some parts
of Greece boys were trained to render hymns musically in the daily
service and on special occasions. The general character of old
Greek music is indicated in the Delphian hymn to Apollo discovered
in 1893;<a name="FNanchor_1997" id="FNanchor_1997"></a><a href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">1997</a> the melody is simple but impressive&mdash;there is no
harmony.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1089" id="p_1089">1089</a></b>. The temple-music doubtless tended to heighten devotional
feeling among the worshipers, and possibly a similar popular effect
was produced by the festivals that were common in the ancient
world. Here the whole population took part, there were religious
ceremonies, and the consciousness of the presence of the deity
was made more distinct not only by visible and tangible representations,
but often also by the fact that these occasions were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>connected in current myths and legends with histories of gods
and ancient national experiences. Processions and pilgrimages
brought the people to sacred places to which stories were attached,
and the religious life became a series of object lessons.
The Greek and Roman calendars contain a great number of
feast days, each assigned to some god.<a name="FNanchor_1998" id="FNanchor_1998"></a><a href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">1998</a> The Hebrews at a comparatively
early date (eighth or ninth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) connected their
great festivals with remote national events;<a name="FNanchor_1999" id="FNanchor_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> examples of festivals
attached to recent historical events are Purim,<a name="FNanchor_2000" id="FNanchor_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a> the Feast of Dedication
established in commemoration of the rededication of the
temple by Judas Maccab&aelig;us (December, 165 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) after the Syrian
profanation,<a name="FNanchor_2001" id="FNanchor_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a> and the "Day of Nicanor" commemorating the victory
of Judas over that general (March, 161 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>).<a name="FNanchor_2002" id="FNanchor_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a> In the Hindu
festivals (New Year's Day and during the spring months) stories
of gods formed a prominent feature.<a name="FNanchor_2003" id="FNanchor_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a> The Greek Genesia, the
season of mourning for the dead, came to be connected with the
victory of Marathon.<a name="FNanchor_2004" id="FNanchor_2004"></a><a href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a></p>

<p>All such celebrations tend to become seasons of merrymaking,
and the religious element in them then receives less and less attention.<a name="FNanchor_2005" id="FNanchor_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a>
This remark holds of the festivals that Christianity took
over from the old religions, adapting them to the new conditions.<a name="FNanchor_2006" id="FNanchor_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a>
Such occasions lose their distinctive religious significance in proportion
as the events they commemorate recede into the past and become
less and less distinct. It is in very early times, when they are
thought of as representing realities, that they are religiously effective;
in later times they give way to more reflective forms of devotion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1090" id="p_1090">1090</a></b>. Vows, blessings, and curses may be considered to belong
to worship in the regard that they contain petitions to the deity;
the curse or the blessing, however, sometimes rested on a baldly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>objective conception of the power of words, sometimes was held
to be magical: once uttered, the word, beneficent or maleficent,
went to its object, person or thing, did its work, and could not be
recalled; its effect could be set aside only by an utterance in the
opposite direction.<a name="FNanchor_2007" id="FNanchor_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a> A magician, by the power resident in him,
could fix a curse or a blessing on man or thing. An exorcism,
also, might be effected by magic or by invoking the aid of a deity;
an evil spirit is a supernatural Power and has to be considered&mdash;one
does not worship such a being, but one may employ religious
means to circumvent him. Bad magic may be overcome by good
magic, and a deity, hostile and maleficent under certain circumstances,
may be placated by offerings. It is not always easy to
draw the line between worship proper and modes of defense against
injurious Powers. But in general true worship implies friendly
relations between human and superhuman persons.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1091" id="p_1091">1091</a></b>. <i>Idols.</i> From an early time men have desired to have visible
representatives of the supernatural. So long as natural objects,
trees, stones, mountains, were regarded as themselves divine or as
the abodes of spirits, so long as a loose social organization and the
absence of definite family life led men to spend their lives in the
open air, there was no need of artificial forms of the Powers. Such
a need arose inevitably, however, under more advanced social conditions.
Exactly at what stage men began to make images it is
hardly possible to say,&mdash;the process was begun at different stages
in different regions,&mdash;but it appears that in general it was synchronous
with some fairly good form of social organization. Yet,
where such forms exist, there are differences in the use of images.
These are found&mdash;to take the lower peoples&mdash;in Melanesia and
the Northern Pacific Ocean, in the northern part of South America,
in North America apparently only among the Eastern Redmen (as
the Len&acirc;p&eacute; or Delawares),<a name="FNanchor_2008" id="FNanchor_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">2008</a> and on the western coast of Africa
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>(Ashanti, Dahomi, Yoruba). Where the cult of beasts (whether
totemic or not) is a living one, idolatry does not find a place; it
is only when communities have begun to be agricultural that they
have artificial forms of gods; that is, idolatry comes in with the
stage of culture connected with the agricultural life.<a name="FNanchor_2009" id="FNanchor_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a></p>

<p>The development in the form of images is familiar. The rude
and, to modern eyes, grotesque idols of the lower peoples gradually
pass into the more finished forms of the civilized nations.<a name="FNanchor_2010" id="FNanchor_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a>
Really artistic forms, however, were produced only by some Semites
(Babylonians and Assyrians) and in the Hellenic and Gr&aelig;co-Roman
worlds. In Central America, Mexico, and Peru images are anthropomorphic
but lacking in symmetry and grace. Hindu idols are often
composite and grotesque, sometimes (especially images of Buddha)
highly impressive.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1092" id="p_1092">1092</a></b>. The Hebrews appear to have had no anthropomorphic
images of their national deity. Down to a late period there was a
cult of household gods,<a name="FNanchor_2011" id="FNanchor_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a> and of these, probably, there were images
in private houses and in shrines, whether anthropomorphic or not
is uncertain. In Solomon's temple (and in Ezekiel's proposed plan)
figures of cherubs (originally divine beings) stood on the walls of
the main room and guarded the ark in the adytum; they were
winged creatures, the forms derived immediately from Ph&oelig;nicia,
ultimately from Babylonia; they appear only in the great public
cult, probably did not enter into the religious life of the people at
large, and there is no evidence that they ever received divine worship.<a name="FNanchor_2012" id="FNanchor_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a>
The Hebrews had no plastic art of their own, seem to have
had small disposition in their earlier history to make images, and
later such forms were excluded by the antagonism of the prophets
to foreign cults and by refined ideas of the deity.<a name="FNanchor_2013" id="FNanchor_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a> The absence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>of images in the Zoroastrian cult may be accounted for in a similar
way&mdash;from early lack of artistic impulse and later elevated conceptions.
In China there are images in household worship, but
none in the great imperial religious ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_2014" id="FNanchor_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a> Though the Koran
does not expressly forbid the cult of images, yet, as the old Arabian
cults denounced by the prophet were all idolatrous, images were
identified with false religion (polytheism) and have been avoided
by the Moslems, whose strict monotheism left no place for them.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1093" id="p_1093">1093</a></b>. Images were credited in half-civilized times with a certain
personality, were flogged or destroyed when they failed to do what
was expected of them, or were bound in order to prevent their
going away.<a name="FNanchor_2015" id="FNanchor_2015"></a><a href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">2015</a> In such cases the conception of the power of these
objects was probably a confused one; though they were known
to be inanimate pieces of wood or stone or other material, it was
believed that they were inhabited by spirits or deities, and it was
held that in some undefined way the power of the divine agent
was transferred to its physical incasement&mdash;the two were practically
identified. This sort of conception soon passed away and was
succeeded by a symbolical interpretation. Whatever the ultimate origin
of the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Hindu divine and semidivine
forms (which are sometimes monstrous),<a name="FNanchor_2016" id="FNanchor_2016"></a><a href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">2016</a> it is probable that for the
more thoughtful worshipers they represented divine powers and
functions. Uncouth shapes may be softened or transformed by familiarity,
and by association with higher ideas&mdash;things in themselves
repulsive may become vehicles of devotion.<a name="FNanchor_2017" id="FNanchor_2017"></a><a href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">2017</a> In all religious worship
objects associated with pious acts acquire sanctity and beauty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span><b><a name="p_1094" id="p_1094">1094</a></b>. That idolatry in ancient times was not a wholly bad feature
of worship is shown by the excellence of the great religions
in which it was practiced. Its general function was to make the
deity more real to the worshiper, to make the latter more sharply
conscious of the divine presence, to fix the attention, and so far
to further a real communion. On the other hand, it tended to produce
a low physical conception of the divine person, and to distract
the mind of the worshiper from the ethical side of worship. Its
moral effect was dependent on the man's character and thought.
When the image was regarded as the symbol of an ethically good
Power, it was a re&euml;nforcement of pure religious feeling; when it
was regarded as in itself a source of physical benefit, it was a
degrading influence. This difference of effect exists in those
Christian bodies that include images and pictures of the deity
and of saints in their apparatus of worship.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Churches</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1095" id="p_1095">1095</a></b>. The history of the social organization of religion is the
history of the growth of churches&mdash;voluntary associations for
worship; it is toward the Church that society has hitherto moved.<a name="FNanchor_2018" id="FNanchor_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a>
Every ancient community may be said to be an incipient church
in the sense that it contains the germs of the later ecclesiastical
development. But this later form exists in such communities only
in germ&mdash;the most ancient worship was communal, an affair of
clan, tribe, or State. Men were born into their religious faith and
could no more change it, or think of changing it, than they could
change, or think of changing, their language or any other inheritance.
It was inevitable, however, that there should be a growth
of individualism&mdash;instinct impelled men to think for themselves in
religion as in all other things. Religion was a part of the general
social movement, affected by all other parts of that movement.
Independence of thought led to social aggregations, the members
of which were drawn together by similarity of ideas and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>aspirations. This is the familiar history of social movements, and
that in religion such movements have been continuous will be
evident from a brief statement of the historical facts.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1096" id="p_1096">1096</a></b>. <i>Savage secret societies.</i> These societies are referred to
above;<a name="FNanchor_2019" id="FNanchor_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a> here we have only to notice their germinal ecclesiastical
character. They represent a partial break-up of tribal communal
worship by assigning special duties and granting special privileges
to certain initiated persons. Totemic groups are sometimes (as in
Central Australia) charged with specific functions in the tribal life;
but membership in such groups is a matter of birth, and they
everywhere tend to give way to secret societies. These latter
often have charge of certain religious rites, and from their secret
proceedings and from a knowledge of their secret lore the rest of
the tribe are excluded.</p>

<p>The extent to which religious organization and influence have
been carried is illustrated by the history of the Polynesian Areoi,
the most remarkable of such fraternities.<a name="FNanchor_2020" id="FNanchor_2020"></a><a href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a> The Areoi created
'mysteries,' with an elaborate ritual whose effectiveness was dependent
on absolute accuracy in words; its members were chosen
without regard to tribal position and entered of their own free
will; it was a voluntary association and made its own religious
laws. It was restricted (as all such associations are) by the necessity
of paying regard to existing customs, but within such limits it
was independent of the tribe, and its members were held to be
entitled to special honors and enjoyments in this life and the next
(a crude conception of salvation). It was essentially a church,
and other societies, in Polynesia, Africa, and North America, approached
this position more or less nearly. They all tended to
become tyrannical&mdash;their social influence enabled them to impose
their authority on the tribe, and they did not hesitate to employ
violence in asserting their rights.<a name="FNanchor_2021" id="FNanchor_2021"></a><a href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">2021</a> To foreign influence they were
naturally hostile, since this generally diminished their power.
Founded as they are on savage ideas they have disappeared,
or are disappearing, before foreign civilizations. In their best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>form they doubtless gave a certain unity to communities and
were thus an element of order.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1097" id="p_1097">1097</a></b>. <i>Greek mysteries.</i> In Greece dissatisfaction with the current
cults expressed itself in various ways, largely through poets
and philosophers, who asserted themselves, indeed, individually,
but showed no power of organization. The task of organizing
religious opinion fell to that new direction of thought (vaguely
called "Orphic"<a name="FNanchor_2022" id="FNanchor_2022"></a><a href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor">2022</a>) which, while it gave prominence to spiritual
ideas and moral ideals, introduced a lively emotional element into
worship. In the Eleusinian and other mysteries this element was
both external (dramatic representations, songs, processions, ceremonies
of initiation) and internal (the hope of salvation). Without
breaking with the popular religious forms the mysteries constructed
their own forms, chose their members, and created a religious
<i>imperium in imperio</i>. They were voluntary associations for worship,
ignored distinctions of social rank, had great ideas and impressive
rituals&mdash;apparently all the elements necessary to the establishment
of churches or of a national church. Yet they faded gradually
away, and perished finally without leaving any definite impression,
as it seemed, on Greece or the world without.<a name="FNanchor_2023" id="FNanchor_2023"></a><a href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1098" id="p_1098">1098</a></b>. The reasons of their failure are not far to seek. They
did not reach the Hellenic mind for the reason that they were of
foreign origin and much in them was opposed to the genius of the
Hellenic religion. Even the Pythagorean reform movement of
Southern Italy, with its strenuous moral culture of the individual,
seems to have had a foreign (Asiatic) coloring. It was, indeed, at
one with the better Greek thought of the time (sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
and later) in its elevated conception of the deity and of worship,
but with this it combined ascetic observances and, apparently,
mystical ideas; it established what may be called a church, which
had a great vogue in Southern Italy for several centuries but did
not, as an organization, penetrate into Greece. It attracted some
thoughtful men, but was too calm and restrained for the masses.<a name="FNanchor_2024" id="FNanchor_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span><b><a name="p_1099" id="p_1099">1099</a></b>. It was different with the Dionysiac cult, whose wildness
made it popular; of foreign origin, it was in time partly Hellenized
and in Athens took its place in the regular national worship; some
of its foreign features were taken up in the mysteries. These latter,
with their enthusiasm and their half-barbaric ceremonies, excited
the contempt of most of the educated class.<a name="FNanchor_2025" id="FNanchor_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> These cults were
Asiatic&mdash;not Semitic&mdash;but probably a product of a non-Hellenic
population of Asia Minor (Phrygia and other regions), developed
during a period the history of which is obscure.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1100" id="p_1100">1100</a></b>. The Semites seem to have produced no mysteries&mdash;there
is no record of such cults in Babylonia, Syria, Ph&oelig;nicia, the
Hebrew territory, or Arabia; Semitic religion was objective, simple,
nonmystical.<a name="FNanchor_2026" id="FNanchor_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> The Syrian cult of Tammuz (Adonis), which was
adopted by Hebrews in the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Ezek. viii, 14), was
an old folk-ceremony, not a mystery; it is allied to the Attis ceremonies
of Asia Minor and to the mourning ceremony mentioned
in Judges xi, 40 (mourning for a dead deity, but there referred to
Jephthah's daughter).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1101" id="p_1101">1101</a></b>. The Greek mysteries, then, derived their orgiastic side
partly from Thrace, partly from Asia Minor. They chiefly attracted
the lower classes and particularly slaves, for they offered
individual independence in religion, freedom from the sense of
social inferiority, and hope for the life to come. Thus they did
not appeal to the Hellenic spirit, and did not, as organizations,
survive the political decadence of the Greek States. But it is
probable that their effects survived in the recognition of the possibility
of religious worship apart from the traditional cults, and,
more generally, in contributing to the establishment of the principle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>of individualism in religion. An historical connection between the
Greek mysteries and the later individualistic cults is, indeed, not
probable. Cumont believes that Mithraism did not imitate the
organization of the Greek secret societies.<a name="FNanchor_2027" id="FNanchor_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> The New Testament
use of the term 'mystery' in the sense of 'esoteric doctrine'<a name="FNanchor_2028" id="FNanchor_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a>
may have come from the Asian cult; the Mithraic worship was
practiced in Tarsus, the native city of the Apostle Paul, in the
first century of our era. However this may be, it seems probable
that the conception of a church existed in the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world
before the beginning of our era, and that its existence was due
in part to the Greek mysteries, whose members were scattered
throughout the empire of Alexander.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1102" id="p_1102">1102</a></b>. The <i>philosophical systems</i> that arose in Asia and Europe
concurrently with the Greek mysteries did not found ecclesiastical
organizations. The disciples of philosophers formed schools, and
the adherents of each school constituted a group the members of
which were united one with another by the bond of a common
intellectual aim and a common conception of life and of the world;
and there was also a scientific union between the various groups,
the fundamental methods of investigation and lines of thought
being the same everywhere. But the object of thought was the
discovery of truth by human reason, not the quest of salvation by
worship of the divine. The emotional element essential to the
formation of a church was wanting, and where philosophical
systems adopted devotional forms these were not the creation of
philosophy but were borrowed from current cults. They sought
happiness, but not through religious ritual. They did not always
formally discard or condemn existing cults, but they ignored them
as means of salvation; they sometimes recognized traditional gods
and forms of worship, but interpreted them in accordance with
their own ideas.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1103" id="p_1103">1103</a></b>. In India the Upanishads practically abolished the national
pantheon and the old Brahmanic ritual&mdash;knowledge, they taught,
was the key to bliss, and the knowledge was not that of the Veda,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>it came by reflection; emancipation from earthly bonds, absorption
into the Infinite, was the goal of effort, but the effort was
individualistic and led to no devotional organization. Ascetic observances,
as a means of attaining perfection, were an inheritance
from popular Brahmanism.<a name="FNanchor_2029" id="FNanchor_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a> In China Taoism, originally a system
of thought (based on the conception of all-controlling order) that
appealed only to a certain class of philosophic minds, became a
religion by borrowing crude ideas and sensational methods from a
debased form of Buddhism and other sources.<a name="FNanchor_2030" id="FNanchor_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> Confucius steadily
declined to teach anything about divine worship; Confucianism
remained merely an ethical system, dealing only with the present
life, until its founder, with disregard of his teaching, was divinized.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1104" id="p_1104">1104</a></b>. Many of the Greek philosophers, from Socrates and Plato
on, were definitely (some of them warmly) religious, but their religion
was chiefly valued as an aid to ethical life, and it did not
respond to the demand for communal worship. The Platonic and
Stoic conceptions of the deity were pure, but they remained individualistic&mdash;salvation
was the creation of the man himself. The
noble hymn of Cleanthes to Zeus<a name="FNanchor_2031" id="FNanchor_2031"></a><a href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> and the fine religious morality
of Marcus Aurelius led to no church organization. The attempted
combination of Platonism and Judaism by Philo was equally resultless.
Neo-Platonism also, though it had enthusiasm and some sense
of brotherhood, showed itself unable to produce a church. Plotinus,
indeed, proposed to the Emperor Gallienus the establishment in
Campania of a city of philosophers, a Platonopolis, in which the
ideal life should be lived, but the proposal came to nothing.<a name="FNanchor_2032" id="FNanchor_2032"></a><a href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">2032</a> The
Neo-Platonic union with the deity was too vague a conception to
bring about communal worship, and the deity had no definite r&ocirc;le
in securing the salvation of men.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1105" id="p_1105">1105</a></b>. Thus, in the period beginning about the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
and extending into the Christian era, all over the civilized world
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>attempts were being made to reconstruct life by ethical and philosophical
systems, by ascetic observances, and by mysteries. These
attempts bear witness to the prevailing sense of the insufficiency
of current schemes of life. They differ according to differences of
place and time, but agree in the search after something better;
this better thing was always ethical and in most cases religious.
Their failure to construct effective organizations was due to the
deficiencies pointed out above.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1106" id="p_1106">1106</a></b>. <i>Buddhism and Jainism.</i> The first churches produced by
civilized men arose in India in the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> out of the
bosom of Brahmanism, whose failure to establish a church was
due in part to its dependence on philosophical speculation. Of the
protests against the Brahmanic orthodoxy the most important were
Buddhism and Jainism.<a name="FNanchor_2033" id="FNanchor_2033"></a><a href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">2033</a> Buddhism discarded philosophy and asceticism,
and came forward with a plan of salvation that was intelligible
to all.<a name="FNanchor_2034" id="FNanchor_2034"></a><a href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">2034</a> Disciples gathered about the Master and he became
the object of enthusiastic devotion. All complete churches have
owed their origin each to a single founder; this is due to the fact
that the insight and constructive genius of the founder have chosen
out of the mass of the existing thought those broad principles that
the times demanded and have presented them in incisive form and
with freshness and enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_2035" id="FNanchor_2035"></a><a href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a> Buddha's followers quickly formed
themselves into associations, the entrance into which was by free
choice. As his doctrine of salvation was nontheistic, so his church
was nontheistic, but not therefore nonreligious. The ecclesiastical
organization was simple, but effective. The original Buddhism has
been degraded, especially in Tibet, China, and Korea, but the
church form remains everywhere more or less recognizable.<a name="FNanchor_2036" id="FNanchor_2036"></a><a href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span><b><a name="p_1107" id="p_1107">1107</a></b>. Jainism, while differing from its contemporary, Buddhism,
in its metaphysical dualism and its asceticism, agreed with it practically
in its method of salvation from the ills of life. It established
a nontheistic church which has had experiences (polytheistic and
other) like those of Buddhism. Historically it is less important than
the latter; it still has a considerable following, but it has never
passed out of India. Apparently its local features, metaphysical
and ascetic, have impeded its progress&mdash;it lacks the simplicity of
Buddhism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1108" id="p_1108">1108</a></b>. <i>Judaism.</i> Judaism stands on the border line&mdash;it was a
cult that approached the position of a church, yet failed to reach
it. Its line of movement differed <i>in toto</i> from those described above.
It had no philosophy, no asceticism, no secret societies, and it did
not rely on its ethical code. It was essentially religious, in theory
a theocracy, in form a national cult. The steps by which the old
polytheistic Israelite nation passed into the monotheistic Judaism
can be traced historically, but the impulse to the movement was a
part of the genius of the people and cannot be further explained.
The leaders of the small body of people that gathered at Jerusalem
in the sixth century, after the break-up of the year 586, were animated
by a patriotic devotion to the national deity; without political
autonomy, merely a province of the Persian empire, the sole interests
possible for the people were racial and religious, and these
isolated them from the neighboring peoples. Those who remained
in Babylonia (where they were prosperous and comfortable) were
similarly isolated, devoted themselves to their own development,
and their religious attitude was the same as that of the Palestinian
community. Distance from the temple led to gatherings in various
places for worship (synagogues).</p>

<p>The Jews thus became a nation organized under religious law,
with an institution devoted to voluntary communal worship, and
offering salvation, at first for this life only, but later (from the
second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> onward) for the future life also&mdash;these were
elements of a church. But in two points this cult fell short of the
complete church idea: the business of a church is wholly and solely
religious, and the Jewish nation was organized not only for religion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
but also for commerce, politics, and war;<a name="FNanchor_2037" id="FNanchor_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a> and the synagogue and
the temple-service were not free to all the world&mdash;only Jews and
proselytes<a name="FNanchor_2038" id="FNanchor_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a> might take part in them. Any religious body, it is true,
may properly define the conditions of entrance into it; but here
the restriction was national&mdash;the synagogal cult, individualistic
and simply devotional as it purported to be, was a part of the
national system, and its membership depended almost exclusively
on the accident of birth. Proselytes, indeed, formed an exception&mdash;they
came in of their own choice&mdash;but they were numerically
not important and did not affect the general character of the cult.<a name="FNanchor_2039" id="FNanchor_2039"></a><a href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a>
The Jews came as near the ideal of a voluntary religious association
as was then possible under the hampering conditions of a
racial organization and peculiar national customs. Their genius
for the organization of public religion appears in the fact that
the form of communal worship devised by them was adopted by
Christianity and Islam, and in its general outline still exists in the
Christian and Moslem worlds.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1109" id="p_1109">1109</a></b>. <i>Zoroastrianism</i> resembled Judaism in its later practical
monotheism and its elaborate ritual, but was more isolated and less
advanced in the formation of assemblies for voluntary worship.
Its pre-Sassanian period produced no church, only a national cult,
which was adopted by the Parthians and others in debased form,
but otherwise did not attract outsiders. On a sect that arose in
Persia in Sassanian times see below.<a name="FNanchor_2040" id="FNanchor_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1110" id="p_1110">1110</a></b>. <i>Christianity.</i> The teaching of Jesus was directed toward
a purification of the existing cult, the elimination of mechanical
views, and the emphasizing of spiritual and ethical ideals.<a name="FNanchor_2041" id="FNanchor_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>is no indication that he purposed founding a separate organization.<a name="FNanchor_2042" id="FNanchor_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a>
But, after his death, his disciples were drawn together by their
relation to him, particularly when the new congregation became
predominantly Gr&aelig;co-Roman. For its administration the synagogue
was the model&mdash;from it were taken the titles and functions
of some of its officers and the method of conducting public
service.<a name="FNanchor_2043" id="FNanchor_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a> But the new ekklesia, the church, followed its own lines
and speedily created a new cult. Its fundamental conception was
salvation in the future through Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ. In
the beginning it was thoroughly individualistic and voluntary. It
had no connection with the State, was not a <i>religio licita</i>; its adherents
joined it solely out of preference for its doctrines; its
activity was wholly religious. But this ideal constitution of a
church was not long maintained. The introduction of infant baptism
(toward the end of the second century) and the adoption of
Christianity as the religion of the State by Constantine went far
to make membership in the Church an accident of birth or of
political position; in this regard Imperial and Medieval Christianity
did not differ from the old national religions&mdash;it was a
religion but not a church. At the present day in the greater part
of Christendom one's ecclesiastical position is inherited precisely
as the ancient clansman inherited his special cult.<a name="FNanchor_2044" id="FNanchor_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a> The word
"church" has largely lost its early signification of voluntary religious
association, and has come to mean any Christian organization,
or, by further extension, any religious body.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1111" id="p_1111">1111</a></b>. The secularization of the Church, the failure to discriminate
between its function and that of the State, is an inheritance from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>Roman Imperialism, which in its turn was derived from the primitive
clan constitution of society in which the individual had no
standing apart from the community. From the Roman Empire it
passed to Medieval Europe, and it has survived in the Christian
world by force of inertia. It is, however, not universal in Christendom
(there are religious bodies in which individual freedom of
choice is fully recognized), and in some cases where it exists
formally or theoretically it is practically ignored. Notwithstanding
departures from the ideal the services of the Church often represent
voluntary worship; such worship, however, has been the rule in
all religions from the earliest times to the present day and does
not in itself distinguish Christianity from any other religion.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1112" id="p_1112">1112</a></b>. The word "church" meant at first a local Christian congregation,
but was enlarged so as to designate the whole body of
Christians. In this body various tendencies of thought showed
themselves from time to time, and new organizations were formed
that constituted new churches in the sense that they had their own
theological dogmas, ritual, and conditions of membership. Most
of them had brief careers and offer nothing of interest for the
history of the development of the church-idea. Gnosticism was a
serious and noteworthy attempt to bridge over the gap between a
good supreme God and an evil world, and was in form a church,
but its philosophical and mystical sides had so much that was fanciful
and grotesque or ethically dangerous that it did not commend
itself to the mass, and soon ceased to exist as a separate organization,
though its echoes long continued to be heard in certain
Christian groups.<a name="FNanchor_2045" id="FNanchor_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1113" id="p_1113">1113</a></b>. <i>Cults of Mithra and Isis.</i> The Mithraic communities
were wholly voluntary associations, without distinctions of birth
or social position, were recognized by the State, but received no
pecuniary aid from it and had no official connection with it. Perhaps
this independence helped to nourish the enthusiasm that
carried Mithraism from one end of the Roman Empire to the
other; a church appears to flourish most on the religious side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>when it confines itself to religion. A more important fact was
that Mithraism was a religion of redemption. It does not appear
that there was any general organization of the Mithraic associations;
each of these was local, probably small, had its own set of
officers, and managed its own affairs.<a name="FNanchor_2046" id="FNanchor_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> It was thus free from some
of the perils that beset Christianity. It is not improbable that some
of its liturgical forms were adopted by the Christian Church, but it
seems itself not to have borrowed from the latter. Its weakness
was its semibarbarous ritual and its polytheism; it yielded of
necessity to the simpler and loftier forms of Christianity.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1114" id="p_1114">1114</a></b>. The cult of Isis, in spite of its ethically high character
and its impressive ceremonies of initiation (as described by Apuleius<a name="FNanchor_2047" id="FNanchor_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a>),
did not give rise to associations like the Mithraic. It belongs
to the mysteries, but had not their organization of meetings
and ritual, had no brotherhoods (except those whose bond of union
was devotion to this cult) and no general organization embracing
the Empire. The reason for its failure in this regard appears to
lie in its lack of definiteness in certain important points: it was in
a sense monotheistic, since the goddess was called the supreme
controller of the world of external nature and of men, but its
monotheism was clouded by its connection with the old national
cults and by current theological speculations&mdash;for Apuleius, it
would seem, Isis was rather a name for a vague Power in nature
than for a well-defined divine person, and particularly it offered
no clear picture of the future and no clear hope of moral redemption,
two things that were then necessary to the success of any
system that aspired to supplant the popular faiths.<a name="FNanchor_2048" id="FNanchor_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> Such lacks
as these appear in the cult of Sarapis also, which never developed
the characteristics of a church.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1115" id="p_1115">1115</a></b>. <i>Manich&aelig;ism.</i> Of the religious movements that sprang
from the contact of Christianity with the East Manich&aelig;ism was
the most important on account of its great vitality. It possessed
all the elements of a church, voluntary membership, independence
of the State (it was always persecuted by the State), and the claim
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>to a divine revelation of salvation. Like Buddhism, Jainism, and
Christianity, it owed its origin to a single founder. Its plan of organization
and its ethical standards were good. Like Mithraism
its basis was Persian (its rise was synchronous with the Sassanian
revival of Mazdaism), but the two went different ways: the former
laid stress on mystical ceremonies, the latter on moral and theological
conceptions. The vogue that Manich&aelig;ism enjoyed was due,
apparently, to its eclectic character: adopting the Persian dualism,
it modified and expounded this by a Gnostic doctrine of &aelig;ons,
which was intended to harmonize the goodness of God and the
existence of evil, and it added the figure of the highest &aelig;on, Christ,
the savior of men. On the other hand, its involved and fantastic
machinery led to its downfall.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1116" id="p_1116">1116</a></b>. Two theocratic bodies that failed to reach the full church
form are <i>Islam</i> and the <i>Peruvian cult of the sun</i>. The Islamic constitution
is based on a sacred book, its theology and its form of
public worship are borrowed from Christianity and Judaism, its
private worship is individualistic, and it offers paradise to the
faithful. But Islam is in essence a State religion rather than a
church. Its populations belong to it by descent; its head is the
Calif (now the Sultan of Turkey). Its diffusion, though due in
certain cases to the superiority of its ideas and the simplicity of
its customs,<a name="FNanchor_2049" id="FNanchor_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a> has yet come largely (as in Egypt, Syria and Palestine,
Persia, and North Africa) from social and political pressure&mdash;in
some cases it has been adopted by whole nations at a blow;
Mohammed forced all the people of Arabia to accept it. Individual
choice recedes into the background, except (as in Judaism) in
the case of proselytes. Its conception of sin and salvation are largely
external. It bears a great resemblance to the Judaism of the Hasmonean
dynasty, a national cult with a priest-sovereign at its head.</p>

<p>Within Islam there have arisen organizations that imitate the
form of a church in certain respects; such were the Morabits
(Almoravides) and the Mohads (Almohades),<a name="FNanchor_2050" id="FNanchor_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a> whose bond of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>union was in part theological, and such are the great fraternities
in Africa and Asia, which are devoted, among other things, to
religious work, and have elaborate organizations and ceremonies
of reception.<a name="FNanchor_2051" id="FNanchor_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a> But these are all largely political and military. The
Ismalic movement (from ca. 900 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> on), the central doctrine of
which was the incarnation of God in certain men and finally in
the Mahdi, was not Islamic and not Semitic; with a nominal
acceptance of the Koran, it was in fact a mixture of Persian and
Buddhistic ideas; from it came the Fatimide califate of Egypt,
and from this (ca. 1000 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) the Druse sect, which began as a
church, but has become merely a local religion.<a name="FNanchor_2052" id="FNanchor_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1117" id="p_1117">1117</a></b>. It was in Peru that the most thoroughgoing identification
of religion with the State was effected.<a name="FNanchor_2053" id="FNanchor_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a> In the old national religions
the individual followed the custom of his country; in Peru the
State, in the person of the Inca, determined every person's religious
position and duties. If Islam resembles Maccabean Judaism,
the Peruvian organization resembled some forms of Medieval Christianity.
The Inca was a Pope, only with more power than the
Christian Pope, since he acted on every individual. The general
ethical standard was good, in spite of some survivals of savagery,
but there was a complete negation of individual freedom in religion.<a name="FNanchor_2054" id="FNanchor_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1118" id="p_1118">1118</a></b>. <i>Modern Hindu sects.</i> The vast multiplication of sects in
India is an indication of activity of religious thought;<a name="FNanchor_2055" id="FNanchor_2055"></a><a href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor">2055</a> the movement
has been in general toward the formation of voluntary associations,
though with many variations and modifications. The
reform sects, while they may be considered as developments out
of the old systems, Vedic, &Ccedil;ivaic, Vishnuic (Krishnaic), have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>affected by foreign influence, Mohammedan or Christian. Of the
organizations influenced by Islam (followers of Kabir and Dadu)
several have produced societies that for a time had the form of a
church, with voluntary membership and a plan of salvation; but
it has been hard for them to overcome the national tendencies to
idolatry and to deification of founder or teacher. The Sikhs, beginning
(in the fifteenth century) as a purely religious body, became,
by the eighteenth century, a powerful political and military organization.
Along with theological reform these sects have been constantly
in danger of reverting more or less closely to the old national
type, and their church form has been only feebly effective.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1119" id="p_1119">1119</a></b>. The case has been different with the movements induced
by contact with Christian forms of belief. The organizations founded
or carried on by Rammohun Roy<a name="FNanchor_2056" id="FNanchor_2056"></a><a href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">2056</a> (early part of the eighteenth
century) and later by Chunder Sen,<a name="FNanchor_2057" id="FNanchor_2057"></a><a href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">2057</a> Mozoomdar, and others are
churches in the full sense of the word, and, notwithstanding occasional
individual lapses into old Hindu ideas, have so far maintained
this character; but they are not wholly native creations, and it
remains to be seen what their outcome will be.<a name="FNanchor_2058" id="FNanchor_2058"></a><a href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">2058</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1120" id="p_1120">1120</a></b>. <i>Babism and Bahaism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2059" id="FNanchor_2059"></a><a href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">2059</a> the transformation of Babism
effected by Bah&aacute;u'llah, is a church in all essential points, though
its organization consists merely in the devotion of its adherents to
the teaching and the person of its founder; it has no clergy, no
religious ceremonial, no public prayers, no connection with any
civil government, but its dogma is well-defined and it offers eternal
salvation to its adherents. Its chief source of inspiration is the belief
that its founder was an incarnation of God, the Manifestation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>of God announced by his forerunner, the Bab (the "Gate" to God
and truth). That its lack of official ministers and public communal
religious services is no bar to its effectiveness is shown by the
favor it has met with not only in Persia and other parts of Asia
but also in Europe and America. Possibly its success is due in
part to its eclectic character and its claim to universality (it seeks
to embrace and unite Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism,
and Christianity) as well as to the simplicity of its dogma
(theism and immortality) and its admirable humanitarian spirit.<a name="FNanchor_2060" id="FNanchor_2060"></a><a href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">2060</a></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Monachism</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1121" id="p_1121">1121</a></b>. An effective outgrowth from the church is the monastic
system, which is an <i>ecclesia in ecclesia</i>, emphasizing and extending
certain features of the parent organization.<a name="FNanchor_2061" id="FNanchor_2061"></a><a href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">2061</a> It sprang from a
dualistic conception, the assumption of a relation of incompatibility
or antagonism between God and the world&mdash;a feeling whose
germ appears in savage life (in taboos and other forms). It has
assumed definite shape only in the higher religions and not in all
of these&mdash;it is foreign to Semitic, Persian, Chinese, and Greek<a name="FNanchor_2062" id="FNanchor_2062"></a><a href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">2062</a>
peoples. Austerity there has been and abstention from certain
things but not with the aim of ministering to spiritual life.<a name="FNanchor_2063" id="FNanchor_2063"></a><a href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor">2063</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1122" id="p_1122">1122</a></b>. The birthplace of monachism proper was India. In the
Brahmanic scheme the highest sanctity and the most brilliant prospects
attached to the man who forsook the life of men and devoted
himself to solitary meditation in the forest.<a name="FNanchor_2064" id="FNanchor_2064"></a><a href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor">2064</a> The seclusion was
individual&mdash;the man was an eremite. The organization into communities
was made by Buddha<a name="FNanchor_2065" id="FNanchor_2065"></a><a href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor">2065</a> and, apparently contemporaneously,
by Mahavira, the founder of Jainism. It is this organization that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>has made the institution a power in religious history. Buddha's
associations were open to all, without distinction of social position
or sex. From India monachism passed into all the lands that were
occupied by Buddhism.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1123" id="p_1123">1123</a></b>. In Egypt under the Ptolemies there arose a sort of monastic
life: after the cult of Sarapis was established men wishing to
devote themselves to religious meditation would go to the Sarapeum
and shut themselves up in cells.<a name="FNanchor_2066" id="FNanchor_2066"></a><a href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor">2066</a> It is, however, not clear that
there was an organization or any sort of communal life in connection
with these gatherings. There is no evidence of foreign influence
beyond a possible suggestion from the fact that Sarapis was
a foreign deity and his cult may have imported foreign ideas into
Egypt; but he was completely domiciled in his new abode, was
identified by the Greeks with their Zeus and by the Egyptians (by
a popular etymology) with their Osir-Apis; there was nothing
foreign in his cult, and the claim, sometimes made, for Buddhistic
influence (through embassies sent by Asoka to Greek kings) has
no definite historical foundation.<a name="FNanchor_2067" id="FNanchor_2067"></a><a href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor">2067</a> Possibly Greek (Pythagorean)
influence is to be recognized,<a name="FNanchor_2068" id="FNanchor_2068"></a><a href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor">2068</a> but it cannot be considered strange
that a practice of this sort should arise independently in Egypt at
a time when a practical monolatry with a good ethical conception
of the deity might dispose some men to solitary reflection.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1124" id="p_1124">1124</a></b>. The Egyptian Therapeutae, the "Servants" of God, described
by Philo,<a name="FNanchor_2069" id="FNanchor_2069"></a><a href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor">2069</a> resemble these Sarapis monks in certain respects,
particularly in their habit of contemplation. Their kernel, however,
was Jewish&mdash;they had the Jewish Scriptures and observed the
seventh day of the week. On this Jewish substratum was imposed
Greek thought; they adopted the Alexandrian allegorizing interpretation
of the Scriptures, and Philo includes them in that group
of persons who found it desirable to withdraw from the common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>life of men in order to cultivate philosophical and ethical thought.
Six days they lived each by himself; on the seventh day they came
together for a religious service. Women as well as men were admitted
into the association, but the place of general meeting had two
divisions, one for men, the other for women. The date of the rise of
the sect is uncertain, but it must probably be put in the Ptolemaic period.
Their monastic organization must be referred to some current
practice, Greek or Egyptian, or to a blending of various lines; the
details of their history are too sparse to build on with definiteness.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1125" id="p_1125">1125</a></b>. The similar sect of the Essenes, or Essaei, which was confined
to Palestine, is better known.<a name="FNanchor_2070" id="FNanchor_2070"></a><a href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">2070</a> The Jewish features in their
system are: acceptance of the Jewish Scriptures, observance of
the Sabbath, recognition of the temple by sending unbloody offerings,
regard for ceremonial purity. Non-Jewish features are: rejection
of marriage, trade and (according to Philo) animal sacrifice,
turning to the sun in prayer (or, according to Josephus, praying
to the sun), the teaching that the soul, when set free from the
body, passes, if good, to a delightful region across the ocean, and,
if bad, to a dark den of ceaseless punishment. Foreign influence
in these latter practices and beliefs is obvious, but its precise source
is uncertain. There are suggestions of Pythagoreanism and possibly
of Zoroastrianism;<a name="FNanchor_2071" id="FNanchor_2071"></a><a href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor">2071</a> it can only be said that various ideas
were in the air of Palestine, and that the Essene formulation was
effected under conditions and at a time not known to us.<a name="FNanchor_2072" id="FNanchor_2072"></a><a href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor">2072</a> The
monastic constitution was clearly of foreign (non-Jewish) origin.
Essenism seems not to have affected the Jewish religious ideas of
the time. Jesus, though he may have taken from it the prohibition
of swearing and possibly one or two other points, was in the main
and on all important points (except ethical teaching, which was
largely common property) the reverse of what Essenism stood for.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span><b><a name="p_1126" id="p_1126">1126</a></b>. Christian monachism, which appeared first in eremitic
form (second century) and later in organized communal form,
may have been an independent creation of Christian piety; but
it is also possible that it was suggested by the traditions of its
birthplace, Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_2073" id="FNanchor_2073"></a><a href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor">2073</a> definite data on this point are lacking. Whatever
its origin, it speedily overran the Christian world, in which it
has maintained itself up to the present day.<a name="FNanchor_2074" id="FNanchor_2074"></a><a href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor">2074</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1127" id="p_1127">1127</a></b>. Monachism has rendered valuable aid to Buddhism and
Christianity by training men and women, laity and clergy, who
were devoted to the forms of religion represented by these organizations.
It has done a higher service by establishing communities
that have often been beacon lights, representing, particularly in
times of popular ignorance, ideals of conduct. Such communities
have often been homes of beneficence and learning. They have,
on the other hand, injured religion by severing it from ordinary
life. By assuming that the secluded life was holier than that of
the world they have tended to put a stigma of unholiness on the
latter. Buddhism taught that only the monk could attain the highest
sanctity and receive the highest reward, and such has generally
been the teaching in those forms of Christianity in which monachism
exists. Monasteries and convents, further, have in many
cases become rich in this world's goods&mdash;a favorite form of devotion
has been to build and endow or aid such communities (often
with the belief that this atoned for sin); with wealth has come
worldlymindedness and corruption of morals. Numerous examples
of such decadence occur in Buddhistic and Christian history. There
are, however, many examples of holy monastic living. It is true in
general of these institutions, as of all others, that when moral supervision
of them is exercised by society the possibilities of moral decline
are greatly diminished; in an enlightened age they may be assumed
to be generally exemplary. Their specifically useful r&ocirc;le in the development
of religion, as refuges in times of turbulence and centers
of charity and thought, belongs to an imperfectly organized form of
society; with the growth of enlightenment they tend to disappear.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sacred Books</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1128" id="p_1128">1128</a></b>. All churches and all bodies approaching nearly the church-form
have writings that embody their beliefs and are regarded as
sacred. Such sacred Scriptures necessarily grow up with the organizations
to which they belong, since these latter originate in literary
periods and claim divine authorship. Great religious communities
naturally produce a large number of such books, and at some time
it becomes necessary (from the growth of heresies or rivals) to sift
the whole mass and decide which works are to be considered to
have permanent divine authority; the process of sifting is performed
in each case by its community under the guidance of
leading men, and the result is a canon of sacred Scriptures. Such
canons are found in Buddhism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity,
and Islam, and in minor bodies like the Essenes, Mormons,
and others, but not among the Chinese, Greeks, and Romans;
Brahmanism occupies a middle ground&mdash;it regards the Veda and
the accessory books as entitled to great reverence, but has never
drawn the line between sacred and nonsacred writings so sharply
as has been done in the group named above.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1129" id="p_1129">1129</a></b>. While the general method of fixing the canons has been
the same everywhere, the details of the process have differed in
different lands. In India the canon of Southern Buddhism (acknowledged
formerly in India and now in Ceylon, Burma, and
Siam) was settled in a series of councils coming down to the middle
of the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> or later (several centuries after the death
of Buddha), the object being to define the faith against heresies;
probably the reports of the Master's discourses (he left no writings)
were examined, and those declared authentic were brought together,
but the date of the final settlement of the canon is not certain, and
the sacred books were not reduced to writing till the first century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The canon of Northern Buddhism (accepted in Tibet, Mongolia,
Manchuria, China, Japan) is less definite and was fixed later.<a name="FNanchor_2075" id="FNanchor_2075"></a><a href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor">2075</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1130" id="p_1130">1130</a></b>. The development of the Jewish canon extended over a
long period, and its history in outline is well known. While the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>discourses of the prophets were regarded with respect as giving
divine revelations, there is no record of the recognition of an
authoritative book before the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when a sacred
law was proclaimed by Nehemiah and Ezra.<a name="FNanchor_2076" id="FNanchor_2076"></a><a href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor">2076</a> Even then there
seems to have been no definite collection of writings. The Law
was the national religious constitution, and in process of time
prophetic books and others came to be regarded with reverence.
The translator of Ben-Sira (Ecclesiasticus) into Greek (132 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)
mentions three groups of national books (the law, the prophets,
and "other writings"), but does not speak of them as divinely
inspired. But the intimate contact with the Greek world, and
especially the Maccabean struggle, deepened the Palestinian Jewish
reverence for the national literature. A process of sifting and
defining, at first unofficial, began, and this work naturally passed,
with the growth of legal learning, into the hands of leading doctors
of law. Early in the first century of our era public opinion in
Palestine had taken shape; the standard established was a local
national one&mdash;books illustrating the national history and teachings,
and written in Hebrew, were accepted (so, for example, the book
of Esther, which is nonreligious but national), others (as the
Wisdom of Solomon) were rejected. For various reasons certain
books (Ezekiel, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs) remained
doubtful. After the destruction of Jerusalem the increasing literary
feeling, the establishment of rabbinical schools, and the necessity
of defining the Jewish position against growing Christianity and
other heresies led to definite action<a name="FNanchor_2077" id="FNanchor_2077"></a><a href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor">2077</a>&mdash;in the Synod of Jamnia
(about 100 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) the Palestinian canon, after hot debates, was
finally settled in the form in which the Hebrew Old Testament
now appears. Alexandrian Judaism had a different standard and
accepted, in addition to the Palestinian collection, a group of books
(the Apocrypha) that the Palestinians rejected. Certain other books
(as the various Enoch apocalypses) were not accepted by either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>Jewish body, though they were highly esteemed. Both canons
were slow growths of national feeling&mdash;books were chosen that
accorded with prevailing ideas; but it is now impossible to recover
all the critical views that determined the results.<a name="FNanchor_2078" id="FNanchor_2078"></a><a href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor">2078</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1131" id="p_1131">1131</a></b>. Young Christianity, at first a Jewish body, naturally adopted
the Jewish canons, but in the course of a century produced a considerable
normative literature of its own. The Christian canon was
settled much in the same way as the Jewish. There was doubt
about certain books, there were differences of opinion in different
quarters, the growth of heresies called for the establishment of a
definite standard, and a final decision was reached in the West and
announced toward the end of the fifth century by Pope Gelasius;
in the East the action was less definite, but the conclusion was
about the same. The books of the Alexandrian canon that were
rejected by the Palestinians were largely used by early Christian
writers, by whom some of them are constantly cited as sacred
Scripture, for they were found in the Greek translation of the Old
Testament (the Septuagint), which was the Old Testament text
used by Christians. So great was their popularity that Jerome was
led, against his judgment, to include them in his translation (the
Latin Vulgate), and by the Council of Trent (1546) they were
indorsed as deuterocanonical, and are still so regarded in the
Roman Church. In the Greek Church they were accepted as
canonical in the beginning and up to the early part of the nineteenth
century, but are now, it would seem, looked on only as
useful for the instruction of catechumens.<a name="FNanchor_2079" id="FNanchor_2079"></a><a href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor">2079</a> By Protestants their
canonical authority is generally denied, though up to the early part
of the nineteenth century they were commonly printed in editions
of the Bible; the Articles of the Church of England characterize
them as instructive but not of authority for doctrine, and lessons
from them now appear in the Lectionary of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_2080" id="FNanchor_2080"></a><a href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor">2080</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span><b><a name="p_1132" id="p_1132">1132</a></b>. The history of the collection of the Zoroastrian sacred
books is involved in obscurity. A late tradition was that many
such writings were destroyed by Alexander. This points to a belief
that the existing writings were later than the fall of the old
Persian empire. When a beginning was made of committing Zoroastrian
material to writing is uncertain. In the first century of
our era Pliny had heard of verses ascribed to Zoroaster,<a name="FNanchor_2081" id="FNanchor_2081"></a><a href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor">2081</a> and, as
Mazdean books were in existence at the rise of the Sassanian
dynasty, the probability seems to be that the reduction to writing
had then been going on for a considerable time&mdash;how long it is
impossible to say. The material grew with the development of the
people and was ascribed to Zoroaster<a name="FNanchor_2082" id="FNanchor_2082"></a><a href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor">2082</a> (as the Jews ascribed their
legal material to Moses). An official collection of sacred writings
was made in the fourth century of our era&mdash;the exact extent of
this collection and the principle that governed its formation are not
clear. It may be surmised that the appearance of strange teachings,
such as that of Mani, and the spread of Christianity eastward,
forced on the leaders the task of defining the orthodox faith.<a name="FNanchor_2083" id="FNanchor_2083"></a><a href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a> In
making their collection they would naturally take only such writings
as were in accord with the spirit of the religion of their time. Thus
they established (in the fourth century) a body of sacred writings;
it does not follow that no additions were later made to the canon&mdash;how
far it is represented in the present Avesta it may be difficult
to say.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1133" id="p_1133">1133</a></b>. The history of the Islamic canon is simple. The Koran
enjoys the distinction of being the only sacred canon produced by
one man. There never was any question of its sacredness, and
there has been hardly any question of its content. Mohammed's
discourses were taken down by his followers in his lifetime, were
put into shape just after his death, the collection was revised a
few years later (under the Calif Othman), has since been universally
accepted in the Moslem world as the authoritative divinely
given standard of religious truth, and there is no reason to doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>that it contains substantially all the teaching of the Prophet and
only his teaching. The scribe Zayd, who acted as editor, may have
altered or inserted a word here and there, but he would not have
dared to change the thought. The traditions of extra-Koranic
sayings ascribed to Mohammed (the <i>hadith</i>), so far as they may
be supposed to be genuine utterances of his (most of them are
spurious), do not add anything to his doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_2084" id="FNanchor_2084"></a><a href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1134" id="p_1134">1134</a></b>. As to the influence of sacred books on religion, it is
obvious, in the first place, that they are always formulations of
the ideas of the places and times in which they originate, and that
they vary in tone and in importance accordingly. It is true, however,
that the canonical collections of the great religions, having
arisen in enlightened circles, all have, along with local (social,
mythological, eschatological) features, generally high ethical and
spiritually religious standards. For this reason they have always
been, as religious and ethical guides and sources of inspiration,
important factors in the development of civilization as well as in
the life of the churches. Their teachings, generally representing
the ideas of gifted men formulated under the pressure of great
religious enthusiasm, have perpetuated high standards, holding
them up in times of decadence and corruption and clouded moral
vision.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1135" id="p_1135">1135</a></b>. A specially noteworthy point in their influence is their r&ocirc;le
of household monitors and comforters. As religious manuals, invested
with divine authority, they have found their way into families
and other small and intimate circles, have been children's textbooks
and parents' guides, and thus have entered in an extraordinary
way into individual life. They have reached wider circles through
expositions and discourses held in connection with stated religious
services. They have been used as textbooks in schools, and in
general have been the most widely read books in the world. They
have thus been unifying forces, each in its special community.</p>

<p>Their influence, further, has not been confined to purely religious
life. Being regarded as containing the final truth, they have been
objects of study and occasions of the development of learning. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>necessity of explaining their use of words and grammatical constructions,
their historical and geographical statements and views,
their pictures and theories of social life, their psychology and philosophy,
their theistic and eschatological ideas, have led to investigations
of all these subjects. Early Moslem science sprang from
the study of the Koran, and the later Moslem discussions of free-will,
immortality and other points were called forth by Koranic
statements. The philosophical writings of Maimonides, produced
under Greek influence (through Moslem translations of Aristotle),
were directed to the elucidation of Old Testament ideas. The
contributions of modern Christians, Jews, Moslems, and Parsis
to knowledge, sacred books being the occasions, are numerous
and important.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1136" id="p_1136">1136</a></b>. Along with these beneficent influences there have been
others less praiseworthy. As any sacred book belongs to a particular
age, it inevitably, in the course of time, falls into disaccord
with later ideas on certain points. When this happens there are
always some persons who, failing to discriminate between the local
and transitory and the permanent, unjustly reject the book <i>in toto</i>;
others, making a distinction, take it as a literary product, accept
what they think valuable, and treat the rest as an imperfect product
of the past. Those who accept the book as divinely inspired and
therefore, as they think, infallible either maintain literally all its
statements (cosmological, historical, eschatological, and other) or
else undertake to interpret certain of them in accordance with
current views. When such interpretation is forced, it becomes
intellectually and morally an evil&mdash;it accustoms the religious public
to logical distortions, and it nourishes a disingenuousness that
easily becomes immoral. The belief that a sacred book is final
authority often results in limitation of freedom of thought&mdash;certain
things are excluded from discussion. The instinctive demand
for freedom asserts itself, however, in various ways: sometimes,
as described above, a desired sense is obtained by violence;
sometimes a religious body that is regarded by its adherents as
authoritative interpreter changes its decision, in accord with the
spirit of a new age, and grants liberty where it had previously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
refused it The treatment of sacred books follows the phases of
general culture.</p>

<p>The dogmatic statements of these books are condensed into
creeds, which become organic law.<a name="FNanchor_2085" id="FNanchor_2085"></a><a href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a> They express each the interpretation
put by a given church on the words of its sacred Scriptures.
The interpretations are the outcome of historical processes,
the final result of which is a formulation of the ideas of its time;
where the same sacred book is accepted by several churches, there
may be several different creeds based on the one book&mdash;that is,
churches and creeds alike are subject to the variations of human
opinion that result from differences of temperament, social surroundings,
and general culture. Creeds are convenient and effective
manuals. They may be made to change their meaning by
processes of interpretation; elasticity in a creed is favorable to
permanence&mdash;it is thereby able to adapt itself to changing conditions&mdash;and
the degree of elasticity depends largely on the persons
who are its authorized expounders, that is, on the area of public
opinion that these persons represent.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1137" id="p_1137">1137</a></b>. <i>General influence of churches</i>. All organized religion has
been a potent factor in human life. In savage and half-civilized
communities it enters into every detail of life, since, in the absence
of knowledge of natural law, everything that happens is ascribed
to supernatural agency. In the old national cults, in which other
departments of thought (art, commerce, science, philosophy) became
prominent, religion was somewhat isolated&mdash;it received a
particular representation in sacrifices, festivals, and other observances;
but such ceremonies were so numerous, and so many
ancient customs survived, that it still played a conspicuous part
in daily life.<a name="FNanchor_2086" id="FNanchor_2086"></a><a href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a> In the period in which churches arose there was a
still greater specialization of the activities of life, and this specialization
has become more pronounced in modern times, in which
from various causes the tendency is to mass religious observances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>in certain days and seasons and leave the rest of the time free.
This apparent banishment of religion from everyday affairs does
not, however, signify diminution of interest in religion itself&mdash;partly
it is an economic arrangement, the assignment of a definite
time to every particular duty, but mainly it is the result of a better
conception of what religion means, the feeling that, being an inward
experience, it is less dependent on external occasions.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1138" id="p_1138">1138</a></b>. Churches, as is remarked above, differ from the old
national religions mainly in the emphasis they lay on individualism
and on the idea of redemption. They represent a profounder conception
of the ethical relation between man and God, or, as in
Buddhism, between man and the ideal of perfection in the universe.
They foster religion by holding public services and by the production
of devotional works; they advance learning by supplying men
of leisure; socially they are in general a conservative force, with
the good and bad effects of conservatism. But their special function
is to treat man as a spiritual being having immediate personal relations
with the deity. Charitable and educational work (ethical
and other) and social gatherings they share with other organizations,
and they are incompetent in themselves to deal with economic and
other scientific questions. That wherein they stand apart from
other organizations is the emotional element they introduce into
man's attitude toward the universe. According to this point of
view man regards himself not merely as a part of the world but
as bound to its author by ties of gratitude and affection. This
sentiment may be independent of all scientific theories, may be
shared by the learned and the unlearned; it is thus a great unifying
force, and gives to life the glow of enthusiasm with the repose
of trust.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1139" id="p_1139">1139</a></b>. The temptations to which churches are exposed are those
that are touched on above, and they may be briefly summed up
here. There is the tendency to an excessive elaboration of the
externals of religion, ritual, and dogma. Something of these is
doubtless necessary in churches as in all human organizations,
but they may easily be carried so far as to obscure the essential
things. The history of all churches exhibits this tendency. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
are protests from time to time, revolts against formalities and
speculations, and then frequently in the new organizations the old
movement is resumed. For our own times a distinction may perhaps
be made: while there seems to be a steady general increase
of ritual, there is in many quarters a disposition to minimize or
curtail dogma.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1140" id="p_1140">1140</a></b>. However this may be, a more important tendency in
churches is toward the claim to absolute authority in religious
matters. This tendency is universal in bodies that hold to the
infallibility of certain sacred books. It is obvious that absolute
authority in an organized body and individual freedom are mutually
incompatible,<a name="FNanchor_2087" id="FNanchor_2087"></a><a href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a> and that all that makes for freedom makes
against the church influence in this direction. Finally, when
churches enter into administrative alliance with the civil authorities,
or assume civil and political power, they to that extent abdicate
their spiritual rights and abandon their true function.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Universal Religions</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1141" id="p_1141">1141</a></b>. So far only particular religions, belonging to particular
peoples or regions, have been considered. In recent years the
question has been much discussed whether any of these may be
called universal. A universal religion may be defined either as one
that has been accepted by all peoples, or as one whose doctrines
are such that it may be so accepted. The term is frequently used
loosely to describe a religion that has passed definitely beyond its
birthplace and has been adopted by different nations or districts.
Obviously, if we take the stricter definition, the question at issue
can be decided only by an appeal to facts. Whether or not a given
religion has actually been universally accepted can be determined
from statistics, and the question whether it is fitted to be generally
adopted must be answered by a similar appeal. It may be held,
and is held, of various religions that their standards are so high
and their schemes of worship and conceptions of salvation so
obviously suited to human nature that they cannot fail to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>adopted when they are known; but such are the diversities of
human thought that this consideration cannot be regarded as decisive&mdash;a
religious system that seems to one set of men to be
perfect may appear to others to be unsatisfactory,<a name="FNanchor_2088" id="FNanchor_2088"></a><a href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">2088</a> and it is only
by trial that it can be determined how far it is capable of conquering
new territory. The test of actual diffusion, then, must be applied
to those religions for which the claim to universality has been
made&mdash;these are Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism,
and Islam.<a name="FNanchor_2089" id="FNanchor_2089"></a><a href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">2089</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1142" id="p_1142">1142</a></b>. Buddhism has had a history full of vicissitudes.<a name="FNanchor_2090" id="FNanchor_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a> Beginning
in Northern India as an Aryan faith, in the course of a few
centuries it overran a great part of the peninsula, then began to
decline, gradually lost its hold on the people, partly, it is said, by
reason of the corruption of its morals, chiefly, doubtless, because
it was not suited to the character of the Hindu people, and finally,
in the twelfth century of our era, left its native land, to which it
has never returned. Meantime it had established itself firmly in
Ceylon and later in Burma and Siam and had been carried to China
(not long after the beginning of our era), whence it passed to
Korea, Central Asia, Japan, and adjacent islands, and as early as
the sixth century gained a footing in Tibet. It has maintained its
conquests outside of India to the present day, except that it has
been driven out of a considerable part of Central Asia by Mohammedanism;
in China and Japan it exists alongside of the native
cults, its relations with which are friendly. It presents the curious
spectacle of a religion, originally Hindu Aryan, that now finds a
home exclusively (with one exception, Ceylon) among non-Aryan
peoples; but among these peoples it has generally been degraded
by the infusion of low native elements, and has discarded its original
essence. By reason of its negative attitude toward life it has found
no favor as a system with Western Indo-Europeans, Persians, and
Semites, except that it gave a coloring to certain Persian sects (the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>Ismailic) and has perhaps influenced Bahaism.<a name="FNanchor_2091" id="FNanchor_2091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a> As far as present
appearances go there is no probability of its gaining general
acceptance.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1143" id="p_1143">1143</a></b>. Judaism is too much encumbered with peculiar national
usages to commend itself to non-Jews. There was a time just before
and just after the beginning of our era when a considerable number
of persons resorted to it for escape from the confusion of current
religious systems, and since that time there have been conversions
here and there; but these have been too few to affect the general
character of religion in any community. Even to Reform Judaism,
which has discarded Talmudic usages and does not differ doctrinally
from certain forms of Christianity, there clings a racial tone
that tends to isolate it, and it does not seem that this isolation is
likely to cease soon.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1144" id="p_1144">1144</a></b>. Christianity, beginning as a Jewish movement, speedily
became Gr&aelig;co-Roman, and in this form took possession of the
whole of Western Asia (except Jewish districts and parts of Arabia),
Greece, Italy, Egypt, and the northern coast of Africa, and was
adopted, under Byzantine and Roman influence, by the Celtic,
Slavonic, and Teutonic tribes. Most of its Asiatic and all of its
African territory except Abessinia was taken from it by Mohammedanism
in the seventh century, but small bodies of Christians
remained in Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt. With this
exception it has since been the religion only of the Western Indo-Europeans
and of a few half-civilized peoples who have been
Christianized either by missionaries (the Karens of Burma, a part
of the Telugus of Southeastern India and others) or by contact
with Westerners (Philippine Islands, tribes of North America and
South America) or by both these agencies (the Hawaiian Islands).
Local peculiarities have been largely banished from its usages but
not from its dogma. It is, apparently, its dogma (in the orthodox
form) that has prevented its acceptance by most Semites, by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>peoples of Central and Eastern Asia, and by many undeveloped
tribes of Africa and Oceania.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1145" id="p_1145">1145</a></b>. Zoroastrianism has never advanced to any important
extent beyond the boundaries of its native land. It has never
recovered from the crushing blow dealt it by Mohammedanism
in the seventh century, and is now professed by hardly more than
100,000 persons (mostly in Bombay).</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1146" id="p_1146">1146</a></b>. Islam is now the religion of the Turkish empire (except
the Christian groups in Europe, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia),
Persia, Egypt (except the Copts), and the North African coast, and
has a large following in Central Asia, China, India, the Malay peninsula,
the Malay Archipelago, the Sudan, and a considerable representation
on the east and west coasts of Africa. Its spread, as
is remarked above, has been effected sometimes by force, but oftener
by social pressure and through traders and missionaries. Decadent
Christianity in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt readily yielded to it;
Persian Zoroastrianism made some effort to maintain itself but
succumbed to the combination of military pressure and the prospect
of civil advancement and peace; after the fall of Constantinople
conversions of Christians in Europe were numerous, and the
Moslem conquests in India were followed by a considerable accession
of Hindus to the Islamic faith. At the present time it appears
to be advancing only among the half-civilized tribes of Central Africa,
but it maintains its position against Buddhism and Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_2092" id="FNanchor_2092"></a><a href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1147" id="p_1147">1147</a></b>. There is, thus, now no religion that, so far as extent of
diffusion is concerned, can be called universal. Omitting the Jewish
and Parsi groups, the Brahmanic and other religions of India, and
the Chinese Confucian cult, three great religions have divided the
world among them, Buddhism taking Eastern Asia, Islam Western
Asia and Northern Africa, and Christianity Europe and America.
It is sometimes suggested that the religion of the leaders of civilization,
the Christian nations, must become the faith of the world.
But, even if we may look forward to a time when social fusion,
under the control of the present Christian nations, shall have
brought about substantial unity of religious thought in the world,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>it is impossible now to predict what the nature of that thought
will be, since Christianity has undergone and is now undergoing
change, and may in the far future assume a different form from
that of to-day; fundamentals may remain, but opinions differ even
now as to what are fundamentals.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1148" id="p_1148">1148</a></b>. <i>Classification of religions.</i> A word may be added on proposed
classifications of religions.<a name="FNanchor_2093" id="FNanchor_2093"></a><a href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a> Certain resemblances and differences
between religions are obvious, and groups may be made,
geographical, ritualistic, theologic, or soteriological, but it is difficult
to find a principle of classification that shall bring out the
essential characteristic or characteristics of every religion and yet
distinctly mark every one off from all others. All have much in
common, and the elements in all are so mixed that divisions necessarily
cross one another. Every religion is the product of some
one community and represents its peculiar view of human life in
its relation to the supernatural; there may be borrowings and
fusions, but the final outcome is shaped by the thought of the
people to whom the religion specifically belongs.<a name="FNanchor_2094" id="FNanchor_2094"></a><a href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a> The differences
between various religions are the differences of thought between
the communities involved, and the differences and the resemblances
are often curious and sometimes defy explanation.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1149" id="p_1149">1149</a></b>. Leaving aside ritual, which, so far as it is a merely external
form of approach to the deity, does not touch the essence
of religion, the following points may be said to be common to all
religions: (1) The sense of a supernatural control of life, and the
conviction that the supernatural Power must be placated or obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_2095" id="FNanchor_2095"></a><a href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a>
(2) The belief that religion deals with and controls the whole of
life; this belief is pronounced among savages, who know nothing
of natural law, and is regarded as essential in more advanced communities,
in which, from the religious point of view, law, physical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>or mental, is taken to be an expression of the will of the deity.
(3) The creation of divine personalities<a name="FNanchor_2096" id="FNanchor_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a> (representing popular
ideals), and movements toward a unitary view of the divine control
of the world. (4) An ethical element in the conception of the
character of the supernatural Power and the modes of pleasing
this Power. The ethical side of religion corresponds to the general
ethical standard of the people&mdash;in savages it is low, but it exists.
(5) The conception of salvation as the goal of religious faith and
service; the salvation looked for is at first physical, is gradually
moralized, and ultimately takes the form of spiritual union with the
deity. These are the essential elements of religion; they all exist
in crude form in the lowest strata of society, and are purified in
the course of social growth.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1150" id="p_1150">1150</a></b>. A classification naturally suggested by this enumeration
of fundamentals would be one based on grades of general culture,
savage, half-civilized, and civilized; but such a classification would
not take account of the differences of character in the members of
the higher grades. These differ from one another in the conception
of the ultimate Power of the world and of the nature of
salvation and the mode of attaining it, and in other less important
points. They are so highly composite in structure that their interrelations
are complicated, and those that are brought together by
one critical canon may be separated by another. Buddhism is allied
on one side (the ignoring of deity) to Confucianism and Epicureanism,
on another side (the hope of moral salvation) to Christianity.
Zoroastrianism touches the Veda in its theistic construction, and
is remarkably like Judaism in its organization. Christianity is Jewish
on one side and Gr&aelig;co-Roman on another. Islam has Christian
and Jewish conceptions attached to the old-Semitic view of life.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1151" id="p_1151">1151</a></b>. A distinction of importance is that between national religions
and those founded each by a single man (Buddhism, Christianity,
Islam).<a name="FNanchor_2097" id="FNanchor_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a> This distinction may be pressed too far&mdash;all
religions have great men who have given new directions to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>thought, and no religion can be said to be wholly the creation of
an individual man, since all, as is pointed out above, are outcomes
of the ideas of communities.<a name="FNanchor_2098" id="FNanchor_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a> The distinction in question is not a
satisfactory basis for a general classification since it fails to note
the theological differences between the various religions. Nevertheless,
it embodies a significant fact: in the course of the history
of the world the three religions above-named have come to divide
the civilized world among them, that is, they have been selected as
best responding to the religious needs of men. No one of them is
universal, but the three together practically include the civilized
world.<a name="FNanchor_2099" id="FNanchor_2099"></a><a href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a> They are modified in various ways by their adherents, but
they have not been superseded. They have grown beyond the ideas
of their founders, but these latter nevertheless occupy a unique
position. Moses and Zoroaster are dim figures whose work it is
impossible to define, but the teachings of Buddha and Jesus, though
they left no writings, are known with substantial accuracy, and
Mohammed has expressed himself in a book. The persons of the
three founders are the objects of a devotion not given to other
leaders. These things justify us in putting Buddhism, Christianity,
and Mohammedanism in a class by themselves, of which the distinguishing
note is the discarding of local national ideas and usages.
These last are not wholly given up, but they are less prominent
than in Judaism and Zoroastrianism. It is to the insight of the
individual founders that this relative freedom from local features
is due. This characteristic does not necessarily carry with it superiority
in ethical and general religious conceptions.</p>

<p>A different line of cleavage is indicated by the designation "religions
of redemption." In one sense all religions come under this
head,<a name="FNanchor_2100" id="FNanchor_2100"></a><a href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a> for all have for their object the freeing man from the ills of
life. In a higher sense the term 'redemption' means deliverance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>from the power of sin and from its punishment, particularly in the
world to come. This meaning appears in definite form in Buddhism
and Christianity, and somewhat less distinctly in Mithraism and the
later Judaism; in the Old Testament religion and Islam it is not
clearly stated. As it appears in germinal form in the lower cults,
its development may be traced up to its culmination in the systems
in which man is freed from moral taint through the agency of an
individual savior or in accordance with a cosmic ethical law.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1152" id="p_1152">1152</a></b>. Unity exists among the lowest and among the highest
religious systems. Among savage and half-civilized cults there are
no important differences&mdash;they all have the same ideas respecting
the nature and functions of supernatural Powers and the ways of
approaching them.<a name="FNanchor_2101" id="FNanchor_2101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a> In the higher cults a process of differentiation
goes on for a certain time while each is developing its special characteristics,
and then a counter-movement sets in&mdash;they all tend to
come together by suppressing local features and emphasizing general
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_2102" id="FNanchor_2102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a> Thus at the present day there are groups of Buddhists,
Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians, and Moslems that, without abandoning
their several faiths, find themselves in substantial accord
on some essential points. The unity of savages is the uniformity
of undeveloped thought; the later unity rests on discrimination
between fundamentals and accessories.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1153" id="p_1153">1153</a></b>. Tabulated classifications of religions, it would seem, must
be arbitrary and misleading&mdash;they give undue prominence to some
one religious fact, they maim the individuality of cults, and they
obscure the relations between certain cults by putting these into
different divisions. The true relations between the various religious
systems may be brought out by comparisons. In this way individuality
and unitary character may be preserved in every case, while
the agreements and disagreements may be made clear by referring
them to general principles of religious development.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>SCIENTIFIC AND ETHICAL ELEMENTS IN
RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS</h5>


<p><b><a name="p_1154" id="p_1154">1154</a></b>. It is remarked above<a name="FNanchor_2103" id="FNanchor_2103"></a><a href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a> that the sphere of religion is wholly
distinct from that of science (including philosophy and art) and
from that of constructive ethics (the determination of rules of conduct),
while it is true that the three, being coexistent and original
departments of human nature, must influence one another, and
must tend to coalesce and be fused into a unitary conception of
life. This process goes on in different degrees in different times
and places, sometimes one department of thought getting the upper
hand and sometimes another, but we cannot suppose that it ever
ceases entirely. The relation between religion and its two companions
may become clear from a brief survey of the facts given
by historical records, this term being used to include all trustworthy
sources of information.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Scientific Element</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1155" id="p_1155">1155</a></b>. Man is bound by his constitution to inquire into the
nature of things, to seek for the facts of the world, including the
human soul. This search is made by both religion and science,
but their procedures are somewhat different. Religion demands
only the fact of an ultimate moral ground of the world; science
observes all phenomena and endeavors to connect and organize
them by a thread of natural causation or invariable sequence;
religion looks behind phenomena to what it regards as its source.
This source is reached by some process of reasoning, either by
acceptance, on grounds held to be satisfactory, of a divine revelation,
or by inference from the facts of the world (as the presence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>of design or of moral order); but, when it is reached, all other
facts of science are treated as irrelevant. If, then, science confines
itself to the observation of sequences, the relation between the two
cannot be one of permanent hostility, since their material is not the
same. They clash when an old nonreligious belief, adopted by
religion, is confronted by an antagonistic scientific discovery; the
first result is a protest, but the mind demands harmony, and religion
always ends by accepting a well-attested scientific conclusion,<a name="FNanchor_2104" id="FNanchor_2104"></a><a href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a>
and bringing it into harmony with its fundamental beliefs.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1156" id="p_1156">1156</a></b>. Certain phases in the relations between religion and science
may be distinguished, but an earlier or cruder phase may continue
to exist alongside of a later and higher one. There is first
the time when science based on a recognition of natural laws does
not exist. The existing science is then one of imagination, the
fanciful application of crude observations to the explanation of all
phenomena. The <i>verae causae</i> are supernatural agencies&mdash;science
and religion are one. Explanations of phenomena take the form
of what we call myths, what the people of the time regard as true
histories. There is no place for the conception of miracle; the
supernatural agents are all-powerful, one thing is no harder than
another, nothing is strange or inexplicable. There is a crude conception
of the unity of God and the world.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1157" id="p_1157">1157</a></b>. The period of the rise and decline of the great national
religions and the rise of monotheistic cults (along with which may
be included Confucianism and Buddhism) is characterized by a
great development of philosophy (in China, India, and Greece) and
a beginning of scientific research properly so called (especially in
astronomy, physics, medicine, and chemistry, in Greece and by the
Moslems of Persia). There is a revolt against the older conception
of unity. Deities are highly personalized, stand outside of the world,
and intervene in human affairs at crises. It is the age of miracles&mdash;supernatural
Powers, by reason of their intimate social relations
with their respective communities, are expected to come to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>aid in all important matters, and, for most persons, there is no
difficulty in holding that they are able to change the course of
nature, which is not regarded as being absolutely fixed. In certain
philosophical circles, however, this view is rejected, and nature,
with its laws, is conceived of as a separate and independent existence,
accompanied or not by gods. Science begins to define the
nature of deities, and to limit the sphere of their practical activities&mdash;this
is a precursor of the fall of the old divinities. The old myths
are retained, but they are purified, humanized, and allegorized, and
in some cases applied, to new persons and events, according to
changes in religious construction.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1158" id="p_1158">1158</a></b>. The next phase is the recognition by science of the absolute
domination of natural law in the world of phenomena. Religion,
when it accepts this view, holds fast to the belief in the
ultimate personal moral Force, and conceives of this Force as
working and expressing and manifesting itself only in phenomena
in accordance with natural law&mdash;that is, this law is regarded as
the expression of the divine will. Science is thus given liberty to
investigate phenomena to the fullest extent, and religion is freed
from the incumbrance of physical, psychological, and metaphysical
theories; the spheres of the two are sharply defined and kept
separate. Such a conception is held to differ from "naturalism"
or "materialism" in that it recognizes a Power distinct from
matter&mdash;to differ from what has been called "humanism" (which
makes man the sole power in the world), or from positivism (which
regards man as the only worthy object of worship), in that it
ascribes to the will and activity of divine spirit the high position
of humanity as the center and explanation of the life of the world&mdash;to
differ from pantheism in that for it God is a personal being
who enters into relations with a free humanity&mdash;and to differ from
agnosticism in that it holds that God may be known from his works.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1159" id="p_1159">1159</a></b>. Whatever difficulties may attach to this conception are
regarded by its adherents as not insuperable. In all religious systems
except Buddhism and Positivism the personality of the ultimate
ground of the world is looked on as a necessary datum. In
the view under consideration it is held that God exists for the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
in which he expresses himself, as the world exists for him, its source
and end. The world, with all its parts and incidents, is conceived
of as a sacred thing, consecrated to God, and ever striving to realize
him in itself, and itself in him. Under the guidance of exacter
scientific thought the old crude idea of the unity of the divine and
the world is thus transformed into the idea of a unity of will and
work. In this conception there is no place for myths, and no need
is felt for miracles: histories of the external world and of human
society are held to rest on observation of facts, and generally the
possibility of miracles is not denied, but they are regarded as unnecessary
and improbable&mdash;they are thought unnecessary because
the conception of the divine character and the religious life are not
supposed to be dependent on them, and they are thought improbable
because they are held to be not supported by experience. This is
the attitude of those persons who accept the conclusions of science;
there is, however, great difference of opinion in the religious world
on this point.<a name="FNanchor_2105" id="FNanchor_2105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1160" id="p_1160">1160</a></b>. Certain scientific and philosophical positions discard religion
as a department of human life. When it is held that man
knows nothing and can know nothing but phenomena, or when, if
something is assumed behind phenomena, it is regarded as too
vague to enter into personal relations with men, religion as a force
in life becomes impossible. In these cases the two conceptions must
stand side by side as enemies till one or the other is proved, to the
satisfaction of men, to be untenable. Meanwhile it appears that
one result of scientific investigations has been to delimitate religion
by making it clear that, while it belongs as an influence to all life,
it cannot include scientific theories as a part of its content&mdash;a result
that cannot be otherwise than favorable to its development.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Ethical Element</span></h5>

<p><b><a name="p_1161" id="p_1161">1161</a></b>. Conduct has always been associated with religion. Supernatural
Powers have been regarded as members of the tribe or
other society, divine headmen part of whose function it is to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>that the existing customs are observed, these customs being ethical
as well as ritual. Even in such low tribes as the Fuegians and the
Australians the anger of some Power is supposed to follow violation
of law. Instructions to initiates often include moral relations.<a name="FNanchor_2106" id="FNanchor_2106"></a><a href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a>
The connection of morals with religion in the more advanced
peoples is close. In this regard a distinction is to be made between
the creation and the adoption and treatment of ethical ideals.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1162" id="p_1162">1162</a></b>. Ethical codes are never created by religion but are always
adopted by it from current usages and ideas.<a name="FNanchor_2107" id="FNanchor_2107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a> Rules respecting the
protection of life, property, and the family are found everywhere&mdash;they
arise out of natural social relations, even the simplest, and
grow in definiteness and refinement with the advance of society,
so that things at one period lawful, and accepted by religious
authorities, are at a later period prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_2108" id="FNanchor_2108"></a><a href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a> Kindness to one's
fellows is common in the lowest tribes, and in higher civilizations
is formulated as a golden rule (Confucius, Book of Tobit, New
Testament, and virtually the Egyptian Ptahhotep, the Old Testament
Book of Proverbs, Buddha). Truthfulness, fidelity, and justice
have been generally recognized as things to be approved&mdash;roughly
defined and aimed at in rude communities, more exactly defined
and more clearly held up as ideals in higher communities. All
these virtues are taken up more or less definitely into religious
codes.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1163" id="p_1163">1163</a></b>. Less praiseworthy customs and ideas also have been
indorsed by religious law. Where sexual license prevails it is
made a feature in religious ritual and other ceremonies after it has
become a part of social usage and law. It is true that it is generally
at first na&iuml;ve, and, being not illegal, is not a violation of rights
and not immoral in the sense in which a refined age regards it.<a name="FNanchor_2109" id="FNanchor_2109"></a><a href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>But it tends, even among savages, to become socially bad, and,
when it survives into times of higher standards, is a corrupting
influence. In this bad form it was sanctioned by religious authorities
in Canaan (even at one time among the Hebrews),<a name="FNanchor_2110" id="FNanchor_2110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a> Greece,
and Syria, and exists to-day in India as an accompaniment of religious
worship. The records of religious cruelty are familiar.
Wholesale slaughter, persecution, torture have been abundantly
practiced in the name of religion.<a name="FNanchor_2111" id="FNanchor_2111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a> Many social institutions (such
as slavery and polygamy) countenanced by a given age have been
adopted in the religious codes of the age. These examples illustrate
the fact that religion does not undertake to fix the details of
ethical conduct&mdash;its r&ocirc;le is something different. This statement
applies to the institution of taboo, as is remarked above<a name="FNanchor_2112" id="FNanchor_2112"></a><a href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a>&mdash;its
ritual rules are not moral, and its moral rules are adopted from
social usage. It was influential in the organization of society, but
not in the way of adding anything to the moral code. In modern
economic and other social questions that have an ethical side the
details are left to science; religion contents itself with insisting
on moral principles as having divine authority, and these principles,
as moral, are already recognized by society.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1164" id="p_1164">1164</a></b>. Discrepancy between codes and conduct has always existed&mdash;few
religious persons live up to the standards that they
regard as authoritative. This failure concerns not the sincerity of
the religious society in setting up its standard, but the conditions
regulating actual conduct.</p>

<p>A natural consequence of the coexistence of religion and ethics
in human life has been that each has influenced the other. Advance
in the purity and clearness of social ethical ideals has had the effect
of modifying not only religious codes but also religious dogmas.
The old belief (founded on the conception of social solidarity) that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>a family, tribe, or nation was punished by the deity for the sin of
one of its members vanished before the recognition of individual
responsibility. The doctrines of eternal punishment and vicarious
expiatory suffering are now rejected by some religious bodies and
circles as unjust. When they are maintained, it is on the ground
that they are not unjust&mdash;the appeal is to an ethical principle.
Apart from the fact of maintenance or rejection, the tendency is
to try all doctrines by moral standards. If they are rejected and
yet stand, or seem to stand, in sacred books, then either the statements
of the books are interpreted in accordance with the moral
standards, or the ethical authority of the books is set aside.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1165" id="p_1165">1165</a></b>. The influence of religion on ethics has been in the way
not of modifying codes but of enforcing existing ideas and customs
and giving an impulse to moral life. It has commonly furnished
supernatural sanctions&mdash;rewards and punishments in this life or
in the other. How far this conception has been effective in restraining
men from actual ill-doing, in furthering good conduct,
and in developing inward loyalty to the right, may be a question.
To answer this question would require such a collection of facts as
has never been made and perhaps cannot be made. We can see
that the belief in divine rewards and punishments has sometimes
been a real power, sometimes seems to have no effect. The character
of the sanctions varies with the growth of refinement, advancing
from the crude savage and later ideas of physical pains
and pleasures to the conception of moral degradation or salvation.
The recognition of rewards and punishments for one's self as incentives
to good living is not regarded as immoral if they are not
made the chief motive&mdash;the prevailing view is that it is legitimate
to look for results of action, that, however, devotion to right must
always be independent of results that affect only the actor. Whatever
the general effect of belief in supernatural sanctions, it must
be concluded that the existence of morality in the world is not
dependent on this belief. The common social motives for practicing
justice and kindness are so strong and so persistent that these
virtues must always retain a certain supremacy apart from men's
religious creeds. The term 'supernatural' is used above in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
more usual sense of 'opposed to natural,' but, according to one
religious point of view, all things are the direct work of God, so
that there is no difference between 'natural' and 'supernatural,'
and the real sanctions of morality are all the conditions of life,
external and internal.<a name="FNanchor_2113" id="FNanchor_2113"></a><a href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1166" id="p_1166">1166</a></b>. The most important elements that religion (though only
in its highest form) has introduced into ethics are a grandiose conception
of the basis and nature of the moral life, and a tone of
tenderness in the attitude toward the deity and toward men. The
moral code it regards as the will of God, conscience as the voice
of God, morality as obedience to God, all activity as a coworking
with God. Nobility is given to the good life by making it a part
of the eternal divine purpose of the world. The conception of
human life as an essential factor in the constitution and history of
the world is common to religion and philosophy, but religion adds
the warmth of personal relation with the divine head of the world.
Into the philosophical and ethical view of the unity of humanity
religion infuses reverence and affection for the individual as being
not merely one of the component parts of the mass but a creature
of God, the object of his loving care, capable of redemption and
union with God. Here again, while there is no addition to the
content of the ethical code, there is added intensity of feeling,
which may be a spur to action.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1167" id="p_1167">1167</a></b>. In the sphere of religion, as in all spheres of human
activity, ideas and tendencies are embodied in human personalities
by whom they are defined, illustrated, and enforced&mdash;not only in
founders of religious systems and other great leaders of thought,
but in lesser everyday persons who commend religion, each to his
limited circle, by purity of life. The special ethical figures contributed
to history by religion are those of the martyr and the saint.
The martyr is one who bears witness passively to what he regards
as truth at the cost of his life; he thus differs from the hero, who
is a man of action. The martyr spirit is found elsewhere than in
religious history, but it is in this latter that it has played its special
ethical r&ocirc;le&mdash;divergencies from established faiths always excite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>peculiarly sharp hostility. When it is pure loyalty to convictions
of truth, it is an ethical force of great moment&mdash;a permanent
inspiration.<a name="FNanchor_2114" id="FNanchor_2114"></a><a href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a> It is less valuable when it springs from the hope of
personal advantage, when a controlling consideration is the belief
that one goes directly from the stake (as Moslem warriors believed
they went from death in battle) to celestial happiness. There arose
at times (for example, in the Decian and Diocletian persecutions
of the third century, and in Cordova in the ninth century, when
there was no persecution) a fanatical desire for the honors of
martyrdom that had to be checked by the Church leaders.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1168" id="p_1168">1168</a></b>. The saint is related to the virtuous man as holiness to
virtue. The difference between them is one not of ethical practice
but of motive and sentiment&mdash;holiness is virtue consecrated to the
deity. The saint, like the martyr, is often an ethical power. When
the title is given officially as an ecclesiastical honor, it may or may
not carry with it moral excellence. In Brahmanism, Buddhism,
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam saintship has sometimes been
contaminated with physical and ritual ideas and practices, and so
far ceases to have ethical value.<a name="FNanchor_2115" id="FNanchor_2115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a></p>

<p><b><a name="p_1169" id="p_1169">1169</a></b>. The evil influence of the religious point of view on ethical
life has been of the general nature already referred to:<a name="FNanchor_2116" id="FNanchor_2116"></a><a href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a> embalming
and sanctifying outgrown and injurious social institutions; substituting
form for spirit; encouraging asceticism; drawing sharp
lines of demarcation between men on the basis of religious opinions,
and so far creating an antisocial spirit.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1170" id="p_1170">1170</a></b>. The development of the sense of obligation to do right
(conscience) is due to so many different influences that it is hard
to say exactly what part any one of these has taken in the process.
But obviously religion has been an important factor in the result
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>so far reached. By its distinct connection of the favor of the deity
with conduct it has tended to fix attention on the latter and to
strengthen the feeling that righteousness is the sovereign thing.
Though such regard for right-doing is at first mainly egoistic, it
easily becomes an ideal, reverenced for its own sake, and more
powerful because it is identified with a person and colored by the
sentiments of gratitude and love that religion calls forth. Religion,
especially in the earlier forms of society, though not only in them,
has been a pedagogue to lead men to the acknowledgment of the
supremacy of the moral law. It differs from other such guides
in the tone of mingled humility and enthusiasm that it gives to
this fealty.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1171" id="p_1171">1171</a></b>. As to the existence of moral evil in the world, religion
can only regard it as the work of supernatural Powers. In the
savage period the question does not come up&mdash;moral evil is taken
as a part of the nature of things and is not curiously inquired into.
In later times it is ascribed to some malevolent spirit or deity who
is either independent of the supreme deity (as in certain half-civilized
tribes) or is tolerated by him (Angro Mainyu, Satan), or to a
subordinate employed by him (lies put into the mouths of prophets
by a deity),<a name="FNanchor_2117" id="FNanchor_2117"></a><a href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a> or to a quite separate divine Power, not necessarily
malevolent (as in some philosophical theories). Religion may adopt
some philosophical explanation&mdash;as that evil is only failure to reach
the good, or only the lower step to which we look back from a
greater height, or an inevitable accompaniment of a scheme of life
characterized by struggle and intended to recognize the freedom
of the will and to develop moral autonomy&mdash;but, from its own
resources it can only say that it is a thing inexplicable by man,
belonging to a divine plan that the devout soul accepts as right
because God has ordained it.</p>

<p><b><a name="p_1172" id="p_1172">1172</a></b>. The theory of man's native incapacity to do right (total
depravity), held by some religious bodies, is antimoral since it
denies human freedom. The attempt to modify it by the supposition
of divine impartation of moral power is inadequate unless such
power is held to be given to every person, and this amounts to an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>indirect affirmation of freedom and denial of moral impotency.
The theory is, however, practically innocuous, being rejected or
ignored by the universal consciousness of freedom.</p>

<p><a name="p_1173" id="p_1173">1173</a>. To the questions, raised by philosophy, whether the world
is essentially good or bad and whether life is worth living, theistic
religion gives a simple answer: a perfect God implies a perfect
universe; this answer is germinal and confused in early religion,
and is definitely stated only in the higher systems. The great
theistic sacred books, Jewish, Christian, Mazdean, and Moslem,
all teach that though there are present limitations and sufferings,
there is to be a happy issue for the faithful out of all distresses,
and the Buddhistic view, though nontheistic, is essentially the same
as this; as for other persons, they are sometimes included in a
final restoration, when moral evil is to disappear, sometimes are
excluded from the happy outcome, but in both cases the scheme
of the world is regarded as good. Leaving out of view the question
as to the exact interpretation of the facts of life, this optimism is
ethically useful as giving cheerfulness and enthusiasm to moral life,
with power of enduring ills through the conviction of the ultimate
triumph of the right. It may pass into a stolid dogmatic ignoring
or denial of the existence of evil, and then tends to become inhuman
and therefore ethically bad.<a name="FNanchor_2118" id="FNanchor_2118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a> It is, however, commonly saved from
such an unfortunate result by common sense and the instinct of
sympathy. And it is so general a conception and its goal is so
remote that it cannot be a strong and permanent moral force for
most persons&mdash;immediate experiences are as a rule more powerful
than remote expectations. But, so far as it is a living faith, religious
optimism is in the main a healthy ethical factor in life.</p>

by Darwin, <i>Descent of Man</i> (1871), p. 65 ff., 101 f., and others. The question is similar
to that respecting conscience; in both cases there is in beasts a germ that appears
never to grow beyond a certain point. On the genesis of the moral sense see (besides
the works of Aristotle, Spinoza, Kant, and their successors) G. H. Palmer, <i>The
Field of Ethics</i>; L. T. Hobhouse, <i>Morals in Evolution</i>; E. Westermarck, <i>Origin and
Development of the Moral Ideas</i>. In regard to religious feeling we observe in certain
animals, especially in the domesticated dog, an attitude of dependence and devotion
toward the master as a superior Power that is similar to the attitude of man
toward a deity, only with more affection and self-surrender. But in the animal, so
far as we can judge, the intellectual and ethical conceptions do not come to their
full rights&mdash;there is no idea of a Power possessing moral qualities and controlling all
phenomena. The beast, therefore, is not religious in the proper sense of the term.
But between the beast and the first man the difference may have been not great.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_331" id="Footnote_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331"><span class="label">331</span></a> Similar restrictions existed in Greece and Rome. An Athenian citizen was not
allowed to marry a foreign woman. In Rome connubium held in the first instance
between men and women who were citizens, though it might be extended to include
Latins and foreigners. In India marriage came to be controlled by caste. These
local and national rules gradually yielded to rules based on degrees of consanguinity.
Marriage between near relations was looked on with disfavor in Greece and Rome
and by the Hebrews, and the Old Testament law on this point has been adopted
(with some variations) by Christian nations. For the Arab customs see W. R. Smith,
<i>Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia</i>, chap. iii.</p></div>

originally as a name of charms used by the natives of the West African coast, is
often employed as a general name for early religious practices. Its proper use is
in the sense of a dead object, as a piece of clay or a twig, in which, it is held, a spirit
dwells. The fetish is often practically a god, often a household god; the interesting
thing about it is that the spirit, generally a tutelary spirit, can enter the object or depart
at will, may be brought in by appropriate ceremonies, and may be dismissed
when it is no longer considered useful.</p></div>

yeast in the Hebrew mazzot (unleavened bread) festival may have come originally
from fear of frightening the spirit of the grain. It may have been, however, merely
the retention of an old custom (if the grain was eaten originally without yeast),

refer simply to the god; it is evidence for the man only when it stands immediately
before the nondivine element of the royal name. The inscriptions are given in
Schrader, <i>Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i>, III, i; Thureau-Dangin, <i>Sumerisch-Akkadische
K&ouml;nigsinschriften</i>. In the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) the king in one place
(col. 5, ll. 4, 5) calls himself "the Shamash of Babylon," but this is of course a figure
of speech; the code is given him by Shamash, the god of justice, and he assumes
to be no less just than the god whom he here represents.</p></div>

The feminine form given to Baal in Rom. xi, 3 f., may refer to the disparaging term
'shame' (Heb. <i>boshet</i>, for which the Greek would be <i>aischun&#275;</i>) often substituted by
the late editors of the Old Testament for Baal. Saul's son Ishbaal ('man of Baal')
is called Ishbosheth, Jonathan's son Meribbaal is called Mephibosheth, etc.</p></div>

no attempt to account for the origin of language. Language was thought of as so
simple and natural a thing that no explanation of its beginnings was necessary. Adam,
in Gen. ii, is able, as a matter of course, to give names to the animals. In early myths
beasts have the power of speech. In a Nandi folk-story (Hollis, <i>The Nandi</i>, p. 113)
what excites the wonder of the thunder and the elephant is not man's capacity of
speech, but the fact that he can turn over when asleep without first getting up.</p></div>

by Taylor are remarkable: from conception came increase, from this came swelling,
then, in order, thought, remembrance, desire; or, from nothing came increase and so
forth; or, the word brought forth night, the night ending in death. The significance
of this scheme (supposing it to be correctly stated) has not been explained. The
r&ocirc;le assigned to "desire" in the Rig-Veda creation-hymn (x, 129) is the product of
learned reflection (cf. Schopenhauer's "blind will"), and sounds strange in the

relation between him and Zeus. It is probable that he represents an older cult that
was largely displaced by that of Zeus. The custom of human sacrifice in his cult led
to the identification of him with the Ph&oelig;nician (Carthaginian) Melek (Moloch), and
his name has been interpreted (from &#954;&#961;&#945;&#8055;&#957;&#969;) as meaning 'king' (= melek); but
this resemblance does not prove a Semitic origin for him. Whether his r&ocirc;le as king of

a patron of children, and so of similar nature with Artemis, with whom she was often
joined in worship. Her connection with Apollo arose possibly from a collocation of
her cult with his in some place; in such collocations the goddess would become, in
mythological constructions, the mother, sister, or wife of the god. This relation once
established, stories explaining it would spring up as a matter of course. The fact that
she was later identified with the Asian Great Mother indicates that she also had a
universal character.</p></div>

relation between her name and the noun <i>venustas</i>, 'grace, beauty,' the special quality
of Aphrodite. If that was the original sense of 'Venus,' it could hardly have
indicated an &aelig;sthetic perception of nature (Wissowa, op. cit.); such a designation
would be foreign to early ways of naming deities. Whether the stem <i>van</i> might
mean 'general excellence' (here agricultural) is uncertain; on the Greek epithets
'Kallisto,' 'Kalliste,' and so forth, cf. Gruppe, <i>Griechische Mythologie</i>, p. 1270 f. The
name 'Venus,' if connected with the root of <i>venerari</i>, might mean simply 'a revered
object,' a deity; cf. Bona Dea and Ceres (creator).</p></div>

and L. Spence, <i>Mythologies of Ancient Mexico and Peru</i>) do not relate mostly to the
movements and deeds of the sun or the winds, but arose from his character as local
deity with universal powers. Social and political events were woven into them. His
contest with Tezcatlipoca seems to reflect the struggle between two tribes; his defeat
signifies the victory of the conquering tribe, and the expectation of his return
(by which the invading Spaniards, it is said, profited) was based on the political hope
of his people. Cf. similar expectations among other peoples.</p></div>

origin of Goodwin Sands, told by Bishop Latimer (in a sermon preached before
Edward VI). An old man, being asked what he thought was the cause of the Sands,
replied that he had lived near there, man and boy, fourscore years, and before the
neighboring steeple was built there was no Sands, and therefore his opinion was
that the steeple was the cause of the Sands.</p></div>

over the forces of the world, becomes, in some cases, the political head of his community
(as a priest sometimes has a like position). Where the divinization of men is
practiced, the magician may be recognized as a god. But no general rule can be laid
down. The office of king had its own political development, and a god was the natural
product of the reflection of a community. The elevation of the magician to high
political or ecclesiastical position was dependent on peculiar circumstances and may
be called sporadic. Cf. Frazer, <i>Early History of the Kingship</i>, p. 107 ff. and lecture v.</p></div>

calm, with consequent strain and peace in life) led to this dual arrangement. But we
do not know that there were specially strong contrasts of weather in the Iranian

the complaint is of inroads of predatory bands from the steppe.</p></div>

means 'adversary,' and, as legal adversary, 'accuser.' The germ of the conception
is to be sought in the apparatus of spirits controlled by Yahweh, and sometimes employed
by him as agents to harm men (1 Kings xxii, 19-23). The idea of an accusing
spirit seems to have arisen from the necessity of explaining the misfortunes of the
nation (Zech. iii); it was expanded under native and foreign influences.</p></div>

xxv, 19; Josh. vi-xi) is not historical, that is, was not given at the time stated or at
any other time. The Israelites, in fact, settled down among the Canaanites and intermarried
with them, and at the time when the passages just cited were written
(seventh century and later) there were no such alien tribes in Canaan. But these
passages show how a current barbarous custom of war could be regarded by religious
leaders as pleasing to God.</p></div>

obligation of opinion was first formulated or created in the world by the early Christian

probably others, had embodied this sentiment&mdash;but the Christian devotion helped to
